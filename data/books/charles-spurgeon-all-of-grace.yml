    title: Do not refuse
    content: |
      Do not refuse the Lord Jesus who knocks at your door; for He knocks with
      a hand which was nailed to the tree for such as you are.

    title: He justifies the ungodly
    content: |
      God has devised ways and means of making the ungodly man to stand justly
      accepted before Him: He has set up a system by which with perfect justice He
      can treat the guilty as if he had been all his life free from offence, yea,
      can treat him as if he were wholly free from sin. He justifieth the ungodly.

    title: How God loves us
    content: |
      Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. It is a very surprising
      thingâ€”a thing to be marveled at most of all by those who enjoy it. I know that
      it is to me even to this day the greatest wonder that I ever heard of, that God
      should ever justify _me_. I feel myself to be a lump of unworthiness, a mass of
      corruption, and a heap of sin, apart from His almighty love. I know by a full
      assurance that I am justified by faith which is in Christ Jesus, and treated as
      if I had been perfectly just, and made an heir of God and a joint heir with
      Christ; and yet by nature I must take my place among the most sinful. I, who am
      altogether undeserving, am treated as if I had been deserving. I am loved with
      as much love as if I had always been godly, whereas aforetime I was ungodly.
      Who can help being astonished at this? Gratitude for such favor stands dressed
      in robes of wonder.
