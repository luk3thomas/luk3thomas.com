    title: Temptation
    content: |
       I should often also think on Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is said, He had
       given him all the kingdoms of the earth (Dan. 5.19). Yet, I thought, if
       this great man had all his portion in this world, one hour in hell fire
       would make him forget all.

    title: Seeking God
    content: |
      But at last, after much time spent, and many groans to God, that I might
      be made partaker of the holy and heavenly calling, that Word came in upon me:
      'I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth
      in Zion' (Joel 3.21). These words I thought were sent to encourage me to
      wait still upon God, and signified unto me, that if I were not already, yet
      time might come, I might be in truth converted to Christ.
