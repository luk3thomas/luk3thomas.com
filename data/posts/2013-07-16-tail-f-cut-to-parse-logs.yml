  Use `tail -f` to parse file logs. You may pipe the command to `cut`, `awk`, or any other Unix command.
  
  A little about the `-f` switch.
  
      $ man tail
  
      ...
  
      -f  The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is reached,
          but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input.
          The -f option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not
          if it is a FIFO.
  
  For example, here are a few lines from an apache rewrite log.

  Let's say I just want to see the timestamp and the text at the end that tells me about the rewrite action.
  
      $ tail -f log | sed -r 's/.*([0-9]{4}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}).*\/\](.*)/\1 \2/g'
  
      2013:16:39  RewriteCond: input='/Users/luk3/localhost/dev6/index.php' pattern='!-f' => not-matched
      2013:16:39  strip per-dir prefix: /Users/luk3/localhost/dev6/index.php -> index.php
      2013:16:39  applying pattern '^(.*)/([0-9]+)/$' to uri 'index.php'
      2013:16:39  strip per-dir prefix: /Users/luk3/localhost/dev6/index.php -> index.php
      2013:16:39  applying pattern '^(.*)/$' to uri 'index.php'
      2013:16:39  strip per-dir prefix: /Users/luk3/localhost/dev6/index.php -> index.php
      2013:16:39  applying pattern '^(.*)/$' to uri 'index.php'
      2013:16:39  strip per-dir prefix: /Users/luk3/localhost/dev6/index.php -> index.php
      2013:16:39  applying pattern '^(.*)/$' to uri 'index.php'
      2013:16:39  pass through /Users/luk3/localhost/dev6/index.php
  
  Now that is nice, isn't it.
  Once new data is appended to the log file it is piped through our rickety regular expression.
  If you want to pipe the `tail -f` to more than one command you'll run into some stdio problems, which you can read about on [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14360640/tail-f-into-grep-into-cut-not-working-properly) and the [interwebs](http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/stdio_buffering/).
