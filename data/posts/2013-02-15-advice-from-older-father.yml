  My good friend Reese introduced me to his parents, Jay and Terri, after [church](http://augustgate.com) this past Sunday.
  I always enjoy meeting new people, hearing their story and talking about life.  It turns out
  that Reese is the youngest of three brothers, and the last to move out of the house. I listened to
  Jay talk about raising boys and being a husband:
  
  > When your kids are young life is busy, and it is hard
  > on your marriage. Sometimes you are just trying to survive, but one day the boys will
  > grow up and move out. When they are gone it will be you and
  > your wife. That is the time when you get to know each other
  > again. Whatever reason you got together you 
  > have to rekindle that passion. 
  > Find that reason you got together and rekindle it.
  > Once you do, It is awesome.
