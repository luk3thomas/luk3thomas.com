title: Will you die for the faith you profess?
content: |
  
  In preparation for [gospel community](http://www.augustgate.com/grow/gospel-communities/) I was reading some testimonies from [Fox's Book of Martyrs](http://www.ccel.org/f/foxe/martyrs/home.html). I read the account of [Coomans](http://www.ccel.org/f/foxe/martyrs/fox111.htm), a martyr, who was executed by the Catholic Church for his protestant faith. I was encouraged to read his account before the judge.
  
  > On his trial he freely confessed himself of the reformed religion, answered with a manly fortitude to every charge against him, and proved the Scriptural part of his answers from the Gospel.
  > The judge told him the only alternatives were recantation or death; and concluded by saying, "Will you die for the faith you profess?" To which Coomans replied, "**I am not only willing to die, but to suffer the most excruciating torments for it**; after which my soul shall receive its confirmation from God Himself, in the midst of eternal glory.
  > " Being condemned, he went cheerfully to the place of execution, and died with the most manly fortitude, and Christian resignation.
