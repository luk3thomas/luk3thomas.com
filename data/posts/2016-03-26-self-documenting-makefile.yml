  Other people do it differently. Here is how I do it.

      help: # Show help text
        @cat Makefile | grep '^[A-z]' | sed -r 's/:[^#]+/#/' | column -t -s '#'

      download: # Download and process recent transactions
        @./bin/run

      process: # Process recent transactions
        @./bin/process

      server: # Start the web server
        @./bin/server

  And when you run `make`

      ~/ $ make
      help       Show help text
      download   Download and process recent transactions
      process    Process recent transactions
      server     Start the web server
