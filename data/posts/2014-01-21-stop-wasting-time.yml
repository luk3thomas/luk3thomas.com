  Facebook provides little value in my life.
  Recently I've found myself fiddling away precious moments of my life reading pointless articles or status updates and then saying _oh that's (cool|weird), [some random person a knew way back when] just had a (had a baby|got married|went on vacation)_.
  Yuck!
  Today, I had enough so I blocked facebook on my laptop.
  All I did was add a few lines to `/etc/hosts`:
      
      127.0.0.1 facebook.com
      127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com

  Now, when I visit facebook.com I get a `This webpage is not available` error in my browser. Yay!
  It's not perfect. I can always go back and in an remove the lines, but It's worked so far.
  Apparently my desire for facebooking is fairly weak and more of a reflex when I am bored.
  Now I'll do something else, like check my twitter :).

  ### Update

  Blocking facebook via `ect/hosts` also blocks social plugins from facebook such as the facebook like button, which is on nearly every site on the web.
