I've been reading _Foxes Book of Martyrs_ by John Foxe.
Here are a few testimonies I found enjoyed reading.

## Ignatius, 108 A.D.

Ignatius was martyred during the third persecution, under Trajan, a Roman emperor.
Upon arrest, Ignatius was transported from his home in Smyrna to Rome.
During his journey he instructed the church in Rome:

> not to use means for his deliverance from martyrdom, lest they should deprive him of that which he most longed and hoped for

Concerning his pending trial and martyrdom, Ignatius says:

> Now I begin to be a disciple.
> I care for nothing, of visible or invisible things, so that I may but win Christ.
> Let fire and the cross, let the companies of wild beasts, let breaking of bones and tearing of limbs, let the grinding of the whole body, and all the malice of the devil, come upon me; be it so, only may I win Christ Jesus!

## Cyril, 251 A.D.

Cyril went cheerfully to his death.

> Cyril, bishop of Gortyna, was seized by order of Lucius, the governor of that place, who, nevertheless, exhorted him to obey the imperial mandate, perform the sacrifices, and save his venerable person from destruction; for he was now eighty-four years of age.
> The good prelate replied that as he had long taught others to save their souls, he should only think now of his own salvation.
> The worthy prelate heard his fiery sentence without emotion, walked cheerfully to the place of execution, and underwent his martyrdom with great fortitude.

## Timothy, a deacon of Mauritania, and Maura his wife, 304 A.D.

Timothy valued the _Word of God_ more than his children.

> Timothy, a deacon of Mauritania, and Maura his wife, had not been united together by the bands of wedlock above three weeks, when they were separated from each other by the persecution.
> Timothy, being apprehended, as a Christian, was carried before Arrianus, the governor of Thebais, who, knowing that he had the keeping of the Holy Scriptures, commanded him to deliver them up to be burnt; to which he answered, **"Had I children, I would sooner deliver them up to be sacrificed, than part with the Word of God."** The governor being much incensed at this reply, ordered his eyes to be put out, with red-hot irons, saying, "The books shall at least be useless to you, for you shall not see to read them." His patience under the operation was so great that the governor grew more exasperated; he, therefore, in order, if possible, to overcome his fortitude, ordered him to be hung up by the feet, with a weight tied about his neck, and a gag in his mouth.
> In this state, Maura his wife, tenderly urged him for her sake to recant; but, when the gag was taken out of his mouth, instead of consenting to his wife's entreaties, he greatly blamed her mistaken love, and declared his resolution of dying for the faith.
> The consequence was, that Maura resolved to imitate his courage and fidelity and either to accompany or follow him to glory.
> The governor, after trying in vain to alter her resolution, ordered her to be tortured, which was executed with great severity.
> After this, Timothy and Maura were crucified near each other, A.D. 304.
