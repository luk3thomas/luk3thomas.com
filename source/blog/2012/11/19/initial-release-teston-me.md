Our team has developed alot of responsive sites lately and we need good way of showing the client what their site looks on an iPhone and an iPad without using the actual device. In reponse to our demand, I created [teston.me](//teston.me), an iPhone and iPad responsive design tester.

A couple of notes:

1. The view on both the iPhone and iPad are slightly wider than the device specs due to the ugly scroll bar most browsers put into the iframe. 
1. For best use a webkit browser (Chrome or Safari) on a Mac to view your site. Since webkit browsers on a Mac emulate the iPhone and iPad transparent scroll bar the iframe windows are the exact size of the device screen size. 

Please check out [teston.me](//teston.me) and [let me know](//twitter.com/luk3thomas) what you think. I used [teston.me](//teston.me) during development ( webkit on Mac OS ) and it actually helped.
