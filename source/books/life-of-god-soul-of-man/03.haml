   # PART III.

   ### On the Difficulties and Duties of the Christian Life.

   I have hitherto considered wherein true religion doth consist, and how
   desirable a thing it is; but when one sees how infinitely distant the
   common temper and frame of men is from it, he may perhaps be ready to
   despond, and give over, and think it utterly impossible to be attained.
   He may sit down in sadness, and bemoan himself, and say, in the anguish
   and bitterness of his spirit, "They are happy indeed whose souls are
   awakened unto the divine life, who are thus renewed in the spirit of
   their minds; but, alas! I am quite of another constitution, and am not
   able to effect so mighty a change. If outward observances could have
   done the business, I might have hoped to acquit myself by diligence and
   care; but since nothing but a new nature can serve the turn, what am I
   able to do? I could bestow all my goods in oblations to God, or alms to
   the poor, but cannot command that love and charity, without which this
   expense would profit me nothing. This gift of God cannot be purchased
   with money. If a man should give all the substance of his house for
   love, it would utterly be contemned. I could pine and macerate my body,
   and undergo many hardships and troubles; but I cannot get all my
   corruptions starved, nor my affections wholly weaned from earthly
   things. There are still some worldly desires lurking in my heart, and
   those vanities that I have shut out of the doors, are always getting in
   by the windows. I am many times convinced of my own meanness, of the
   weakness of my body, and the far greater weakness of my soul; but this
   doth rather beget indignation and discontent, than true humility in my
   spirit. And though I should come to think meanly of myself, yet I
   cannot endure that others should think so too. In a word, when I
   reflect on my highest and most specious attainments, I have reason to
   suspect, that they are all but the effects of nature, the issues of
   self-love acting under several disguises; and this principle is so
   powerful, and so deeply rooted in me, that I can never hope to be
   delivered from the dominion of it. I may toss and turn as a door on the
   hinges, but can never get clear off, or be quite unhinged of self,
   which is still the centre of all my motions; so that all the advantage
   I can draw from the discovery of religion, is but to see, at a huge
   distance, that felicity which I am not able to reach; like a man in a
   shipwreck, who discerns the land, and envies the happiness of those who
   are there, but thinks it impossible for himself to get ashore."

   These, I say, or such like desponding thoughts, may arise in the minds
   of those persons who begin to conceive somewhat more of the nature and
   excellency of religion than before. They have spied the land, and seen
   that it is exceeding good, that it floweth with milk and honey; but
   they find they have the children of Anak to grapple with, many powerful
   lusts and corruptions to overcome, and they fear they shall never
   prevail against them. But why should we give way to such discouraging
   suggestions? Why should we entertain such unreasonable fears, which
   damp our spirits and weaken our hands, and augment the difficulties of
   our way? Let us encourage ourselves, my dear friend, let us encourage
   ourselves with those mighty aids we are to expect in this spiritual
   warfare; for greater is he that is for us, than all that rise up
   against us. "The eternal God is our refuge, and underneath are the
   everlasting arms. Let us be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might," for he it is that shall "tread down our enemies." God hath a
   tender regard unto the souls of men, and is infinitely willing to
   promote their welfare. He hath condescended to our weakness, and
   declared with an oath, that he hath no pleasure in our destruction.
   There is no such thing as dispute or envy lodged in the bosom of that
   ever-blessed Being, whose name and nature is Love. He created us at
   first in a happy condition; and now, when we are fallen from it, "He
   hath laid help upon one that is mighty to save," hath committed the
   care of our souls to no meaner person than the Eternal Son of his love.
   It is he that is the Captain of our salvation, and what enemies can be
   too strong for us when we are fighting under his banners? Did not the
   Son of God come down from the bosom of his Father, and pitch his
   tabernacle amongst the sons of men, that he might recover and propagate
   the divine life, and restore the image of God in their souls? All the
   mighty works which he performed, all the sad afflictions which he
   sustained, had this for their scope and design; for this did he labour
   and toil, for this did he bleed and die. "He was with child, he was in
   pain, and hath he brought forth nothing but wind; hath he wrought no
   deliverance in the earth? Shall he not see of the travail of his soul?"
   Certainly it is impossible that this great contrivance of heaven should
   prove abortive, that such a mighty undertaking should fail and
   miscarry. It hath already been effectual for the salvation of many
   thousands, who were once as far from the kingdom of heaven as we can
   suppose ourselves to be, and our "High Priest continueth for ever, and
   is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him." He is
   tender and compassionate, he knoweth our infirmities, and had
   experience of our temptations. "A bruised reed will he not break, and
   smoking flax will he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto
   victory." He hath sent out his Holy Spirit, whose sweet but powerful
   breathings are still moving up and down in the world, to quicken and
   revive the souls of men, and awaken them unto the sense and feeling of
   those divine things for which they were made, and is ready to assist
   such weak and languishing creatures as we are, in our essays towards
   holiness and felicity: and when once it hath taken hold of a soul, and
   kindled in it the smallest spark of divine love, it will be sure to
   preserve and cherish, and bring it forth into a flame, "which many
   waters shall not quench, neither shall the floods be able to drown it."
   Whenever this day begins to dawn, "and the day-star to arise in the
   heart," it will easily dispel the powers of darkness, and make
   ignorance and folly, and all the corrupt and selfish affections of men,
   flee away as fast before it as the shades of night, when the sun cometh
   out of his chambers: "For the path of the just is as the shining light,
   which shineth more and more unto the perfect day. They shall go on from
   strength to strength, till every one of them appear before God in
   Zion."

   Why should we think it impossible, that true goodness and universal
   love should ever come to sway and prevail in our souls? Is not this
   their primitive state and condition, their native and genuine
   constitution, as they came first from the hands of their Maker? Sin and
   corruption are but usurpers, and though they have long kept possession,
   "yet from the beginning it was not so." That inordinate self-love,
   which one would think were rooted in our very being, and interwoven
   with the constitution of our nature, is nevertheless of a foreign
   extraction, and had no place at all in the state of integrity. We have
   still so much reason left as to condemn it; our understandings are
   easily convinced, that we ought to be wholly devoted to him from whom
   we have our being, and to love him infinitely more than ourselves, who
   is infinitely better than we; and our wills would readily comply with
   this, if they were not disordered and put out of tune: and is not he
   who made our souls, able to rectify and mend them again? Shall we not
   be able, by his assistance, to vanquish and expel those violent
   intruders, "and turn unto flight the armies of the aliens?"

   No sooner shall we take up arms in this holy war, but we shall have all
   the saints on earth, and all the angels in heaven, engaged on our
   party. The holy church throughout the world is daily interceding with
   God for the success of all such endeavours; and, doubtless, those
   heavenly hosts above are nearly concerned in the interests of religion,
   and infinitely desirous to see the divine life thriving and prevailing
   in this inferior world; and that the will of God may be done by us on
   earth, as it is done by themselves in heaven. And may we not then
   encourage ourselves, as the prophet did His servant, when he showed him
   the horses and chariots of fire, "Fear not, for they that be with us
   are more than they that be against us?"

   Away then with all perplexing fears and desponding thoughts. To
   undertake vigorously, and rely confidently on the divine assistance, is
   more than half the conquest. "Let us arise and be doing, and the Lord
   will be with us." It is true, religion in the souls of men is the
   immediate work of God, and all our natural endeavours can neither
   produce it alone, nor merit those supernatural aids by which it must be
   wrought. The Holy Ghost must come upon us, and the power of the Highest
   must overthrow us, before that holy thing can be begotten, and Christ
   be formed in us. But yet we must not expect that this whole work should
   be done without any concurring endeavours of our own. We must not lie
   loitering in the ditch, and wait till Omnipotence pull us from thence.
   No, no: we must bestir ourselves, and actuate those powers which we
   have already received. We must put forth ourselves to our utmost
   capacities, and then we may hope that "our labour shall not be in vain
   in the Lord." All the art and industry of man cannot form the smallest
   herb, or make a stalk of corn to grow in the field; it is the energy of
   nature, and the influences of Heaven, which produce this effect. It is
   God "who causeth the grass to grow, and herb for the service of man;"
   and yet nobody will say, that the labours of the husbandman are useless
   or unnecessary. So, likewise, the human soul is immediately created by
   God. It is he who both formeth and enliveneth the child; and yet he
   hath appointed the marriage-bed as the ordinary means for the
   propagation of mankind. Though there must intervene a stroke of
   Omnipotence to effect this mighty change in our souls, yet ought we to
   do what we can to fit and prepare ourselves; for we must break up our
   fallow ground, and root out the weeds, and pull up the thorns, that so
   we may be more ready to receive the seeds of grace, and the dew of
   heaven. It is true, God hath been found of some who sought Him not. He
   hath cast himself in their way, who were quite out of his. He hath laid
   hold upon them, and stopped their course on a sudden; for so was St.
   Paul converted in his journey to Damascus. But certainly this is not
   God's ordinary method of dealing with men. Though he hath not tied
   himself to means, yet he hath tied us to the use of them; and we have
   never more reason to expect the divine assistance, than when we are
   doing our utmost endeavours. It shall therefore be my next work, to
   show what course we ought to take for attaining that blessed temper I
   have hitherto described. But here, if, in delivering my own thoughts, I
   shall chance to differ from what is or may be said by others in this
   matter, I would not be thought to contradict and oppose them, more than
   physicians do, when they prescribe several remedies for the same
   disease, which perhaps are all useful and good. "Every one may propose
   the method he judges most proper and convenient; but he doth not
   thereby pretend that the cure can never be effected, unless that be
   exactly observed. I doubt it hath occasioned much unnecessary
   disquietude to some holy persons, that they have not found such a
   regular and orderly transaction in their souls, as they have seen
   described in books; that they have not passed through all those steps
   and stages of conversion, which some (who perhaps have felt them in
   themselves) have too peremptorily prescribed unto others. God hath
   several ways of dealing with the souls of men, and it sufficeth if the
   work be accomplished, whatever the methods have been.

   Again, though in proposing directions I must follow that order which
   the nature of things shall lead to, yet I do not mean that the same
   method should be so punctually observed in the practice, as if the
   latter rules were never to be heeded till some considerable time have
   been spent in practising the former. The directions I intend are
   mutually conducive one to another, and are all to be performed as
   occasion shall serve, and we find ourselves enabled to perform them.

   But now, that I may detain you no longer, if we desire to have our
   souls moulded to this holy frame, to become partakers of the divine
   nature, and have Christ formed in our hearts, we must seriously
   resolve, and carefully endeavour, to avoid and abandon all vicious and
   sinful practices. There can be no treaty of peace, till once we lay
   down these weapons of rebellion wherewith we fight against heaven; nor
   can we expect to have our distempers cured, if we be daily feeding on
   poison. Every wilful sin gives a mortal wound to the soul, and puts it
   at a greater distance from God and goodness; and we can never hope to
   have our hearts purified from corrupt affections, unless we cleanse our
   hands from vicious actions. Now, in this case we cannot excuse
   ourselves by the pretence of impossibility; for sure our outward man is
   some way in our power. We have some command of our feet, and hands, and
   tongue, nay, and of our thoughts and fancies too, at least so far as to
   divert them from impure and sinful objects, and to turn our mind
   another way; and we find this power and authority much strengthened and
   advanced, if we were careful to manage and exercise it. In the mean
   while, I acknowledge our corruptions are so strong, and our temptations
   so many, that it will require a great deal of steadfastness and
   resolution, of watchfulness and care, to preserve ourselves, even in
   this degree of innocence and purity.

   And, first, let us inform ourselves well what those sins are from which
   we ought to abstain. And here we must not take our measures from the
   maxims of the world, or the practices of those whom in charity we
   account good men. Most people have very light apprehensions of these
   things, and are not sensible of any fault, unless it be gross and
   flagitious, and scarce reckon any so great as that which they call
   preciseness: and those who are more serious, do many times allow
   themselves too great latitude and freedom. Alas! how much pride and
   vanity, and passion and honour; how much weakness, and folly, and sin,
   doth every day show itself in their converse and behaviour? It may be
   they are humbled for it, and striving against it, and are daily gaining
   some ground: but then the progress is so small, and their failings so
   many, that we have need to choose a more exact pattern. Every one of us
   must answer for himself, and the practices of others will never warrant
   and secure us. It is the highest folly to regulate our actions by any
   other standard than that by which we must be judged. If ever we would
   cleanse our way, it must be "by taking heed thereto according to the
   word of God;" and that "word which is quick and powerful, and sharper
   than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul
   and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
   thoughts and intents of the heart," will certainly discover many things
   to be sinful and hideous, which pass for very innocent in the eyes of
   the world. Let us therefore imitate the Psalmist, who saith,
   "Concerning the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have kept
   myself from the paths of the destroyer." Let us acquaint ourselves with
   the strict and holy laws of our religion. Let us consider the
   discourses of our blessed Saviour, (especially that divine sermon on
   the mount,) and the writings of his holy apostles, where an ingenuous
   and unbiassed mind may clearly discern those limits and bounds by which
   our actions ought to be confined. And then let us never look upon any
   sin as light and inconsiderable; but be fully persuaded, that the
   smallest is infinitely heinous in the sight of God, and prejudicial to
   the souls of men; and that, if we had the right sense of things, we
   should be as deeply affected with the least irregularities, as now we
   are with the highest crimes.

   But now, amongst those things which we discover to be sinful, there
   will be some unto which, through the disposition of our nature, or long
   custom, or the endearments of pleasure, we are so much wedded, that it
   will be like cutting off the right hand, or pulling out the right eye,
   to abandon them. But must we therefore sit down and wait till all
   difficulties be over, and every temptation be gone? This were to
   imitate the fool in the poet, who stood the whole day at the river-side
   till all the water should run by. We must not indulge our inclinations,
   as we do little children, till they grow weary of the thing they are
   unwilling to let go. We must not continue our sinful practices, in
   hopes that the divine grace will one day overpower our spirits, and
   make us hate them for their own deformity.

   Let us suppose that we are utterly destitute of any supernatural
   principle, and want that taste by which we should discern and abhor
   perverse things; yet sure we are capable of some considerations which
   may be of force to persuade us to this reformation of our lives. If the
   inward deformity and heinous nature of sin cannot affect us, at least
   we may be frightened by those dreadful consequences that attend it:
   that same selfish principle which pusheth us forward unto the pursuit
   of sinful pleasures, will make us loath to buy them at the rate of
   everlasting misery. Thus we may encounter self-love with its own
   weapons, and employ one natural inclination for repressing the
   exorbitancies of another. Let us therefore accustom ourselves to
   consider seriously, what a fearful thing it must needs be to irritate
   and offend that infinite Being on whom we hang and depend every moment,
   who needs but to withdraw his mercies to make us miserable, or his
   assistance to make us nothing. Let us frequently remember the shortness
   and uncertainty of our lives, and how that, after we have taken a few
   more turns in the world, and conversed a little longer amongst men, we
   must all go down unto the dark and silent grave, and carry nothing
   along with us but anguish and regret for all our sinful enjoyments; and
   then think what horror must needs seize the guilty soul, to find itself
   naked and all alone before the severe and impartial Judge of the world,
   to render an exact account, not only of its more important and
   considerable transactions, but of every word that the tongue hath
   uttered, and the swiftest and most secret thought that ever passed
   through the mind. Let us sometimes represent unto ourselves the terrors
   of that dreadful day, when the foundation of the earth shall be shaken,
   and the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
   shall melt with fervent heat, and the present frame of nature be
   dissolved, and our eyes shall see the blessed Jesus, (who came once
   into the world in all humility to visit us, to purchase pardon for us,
   and beseech us to accept of it,) now appearing in the majesty of his
   glory, and descending from heaven in a flaming fire, to take vengeance
   on those that have despised his mercy, and persisted in rebellion
   against him. When all the hidden things of darkness shall be brought to
   light, and the counsels of the heart shall be made manifest; when those
   secret impurities and subtle frauds whereof the world did never suspect
   us, shall be exposed and laid open to public view, and many thousand
   actions which we never dreamed to be sinful, or else had altogether
   forgotten, shall be charged home upon our consciences, with such
   evident convictions of guilt, that we shall neither be able to deny nor
   excuse them. Then shall all the angels in heaven, and all the saints
   that ever lived on the earth, approve that dreadful sentence which
   shall be passed on wicked men; and those who perhaps did love and
   esteem them when they lived in the world, shall look upon them with
   indignation and abhorrence, and never make one request for their
   deliverance. Let us consider the eternal punishment of damned souls,
   which are shadowed forth in Scripture by metaphors taken from those
   things that are most terrible and grievous in the world, and yet all do
   not suffice to convey into our minds any full apprehensions of them.
   When we have joined together the importance of all these expressions,
   and added unto them whatever our fancy can conceive of misery and
   torment, we must still remember, that all this comes infinitely short
   of the truth and reality of the thing.

   It is true, this is a sad and melancholy subject; there is anguish and
   horror in the consideration of it; but sure it must be infinitely more
   dreadful to endure it: and such thoughts as these may be very useful to
   fright us from the courses that would lead us thither; how fond soever
   we may be of sinful pleasures, the fear of hell would make us abstain.
   Our most forward inclinations will startle and give back, when pressed
   with that question in the prophet, "Who amongst us can dwell with
   everlasting burnings?"

   To this very purpose it is that the terrors of another world are so
   frequently represented in holy writ, and that in such terms as are most
   proper to affect and influence a carnal mind: these fears can never
   suffice to make any person truly good; but certainly they may restrain
   us from much evil, and have often made way for more ingenious and
   kindly impressions.

   But it will not suffice to consider these things once and again, nor to
   form some resolutions of abandoning our sins, unless we maintain a
   constant guard, and be continually watching against them. Sometimes the
   mind is awakened to see the dismal consequences of a vicious life, and
   straight we are resolved to reform; but, alas! it presently falleth
   asleep, and we lose that prospect which we had of things, and then
   temptations take the advantage; they solicit and importune us
   continually, and so do frequently engage our consent before we are
   aware. It is the folly and ruin of most people to live at adventure,
   and take part in every thing that comes in their way, seldom
   considering what they are about to say or do. If we would have our
   resolutions take effect, we must take heed unto our ways, and set a
   watch before the door of our lips, and examine the motions that arise
   in our hearts, and cause them to tell us whence they come, and whither
   they go; whether it be pride or passion, or any corrupt and vicious
   humour, that prompteth us to any design, and whether God will be
   offended or any body harmed by it. And if we have no time for long
   reasonings, let us at least turn our eyes toward God, and place
   ourselves in his presence, to ask his leave and approbation for what we
   do. Let us consider ourselves under the all-seeing eye of that divine
   Majesty, as in the midst of an infinite globe of light, which
   compasseth us about both behind and before, and pierceth to the
   innermost corners of the soul. The sense and remembrance of the divine
   presence is the most ready and effectual means, both to discover what
   is unlawful, and to restrain us from it. There are some things a person
   could make a shift to pelliate or defend, and yet he dares not look
   Almighty God in the face, and adventure upon them. If we look unto him
   we shall be lightened; if we "set him always before us, he will guide
   us by his eye, and instruct us in the way wherein we ought to walk."

   This care and watchfulness over our actions must be seconded by
   frequent and serious reflections upon them, not only that we may obtain
   the divine mercy and pardon for our sins, by an humble and sorrowful
   acknowledgment of them; but also that we may re-enforce and strengthen
   our resolutions, and learn to decline or resist the temptations by
   which we have been formerly foiled. It is an advice worthy of a
   Christian, though it did first drop from a heathen pen, that before we
   betake ourselves to rest, we renew and examine all the passages of the
   day, that we may have the comfort of what we have done aright, and may
   redress what we find to have been done amiss, and make the shipwrecks
   of one day be as marks to direct our course in another. This may be
   called the very art of virtuous living, and would contribute
   wonderfully to advance our reformation, and preserve our innocence.
   But, withal, we must nor forget to implore the divine assistance,
   especially against those sins that do most easily beset us: and though
   it be supposed that our hearts are not yet moulded into that spiritual
   frame which should render our devotions acceptable; yet, methinks, such
   considerations as have been proposed to deter us from sin, may also
   stir us up to some natural seriousness, and make our prayers against it
   as earnest, at least, as they are wont to be against other calamities:
   and I doubt not but God, who heareth the cry of the ravens, will have
   some regard even to such petitions as proceed from those natural
   passions which himself hath implanted in us. Besides, that those
   prayers against sin, will be powerful engagements on ourselves to
   excite us to watchfulness and care; and common ingenuity will make us
   ashamed to relapse into those faults which we have lately bewailed
   before God, and against which we have begged his assistance.

   Thus are we to make the first essay for recovering the divine life, by
   restraining the natural inclinations, that they break not out into
   sinful practices. But now I must add, that Christian prudence will
   teach us to abstain from gratifications that are not simply unlawful,
   and that, not only that we may secure our innocence, which would be in
   continual hazzard, if we should strain our liberty to the utmost point;
   but also, that thereby we may weaken the force of nature, and teach our
   appetites to obey. We must do with ourselves as prudent parents with
   their children, who cross their wills in many little indifferent
   things, to make them manageable and submissive in more considerable
   instances. He who would mortify the pride and vanity of his spirit,
   should stop his ears to the most deserved praises, and sometimes
   forbear his just vindication from the censures and aspersions of
   others, especially if they reflect only upon his prudence and conduct,
   and not on his virtue and innocence. He who would check a revengeful
   humour, would do well to deny himself the satisfaction of representing
   unto others the injuries which he hath sustained; and if we would so
   take heed to our ways, that we sin not with our tongue, we must
   accustom ourselves much to solitude and silence, and sometimes with the
   Psalmist, "hold our peace even from good," till once we have gotten
   some command over that unruly member. Thus, I say, we may bind up our
   natural inclinations, and make our appetites more moderate in their
   cravings, by accustoming them to frequent refusals; but it is not
   enough to have them under violence and restraint.

   Our next essay must be, to wean our affections from created things, and
   all the delights and entertainments of the lower life, which sink and
   depress the souls of men, and retard their motions towards God and
   heaven; and this we must do by possessing our minds with a deep
   persuasion of the vanity and emptiness of worldly enjoyments. This is
   an ordinary theme, and every body can make declamations upon it; but,
   alas! how few understand or believe what they say? These notions float
   in our brains, and come sliding off our tongues, but we have no deep
   impression of them on our spirits; we feel not the truth which we
   pretend to believe. We can tell, that all the glory and splendour, all
   the pleasures and enjoyments of the world are vanity and nothing; and
   yet these nothings take up all our thoughts, and engross all our
   affections; they stifle the better inclinations of our soul, and
   inveigle us into many a sin. It may be in a sober mood we give them the
   slight, and resolve to be no longer deluded with them; but those
   thoughts seldom outlive the next temptation; the vanities which we have
   shut out at the doors get in at a postern: there are still some
   pretensions, some hopes that flatter us; and after we have been
   frustrated a thousand times, we must be continually repeating the
   experiment: the least difference of circumstances is enough to delude
   us, and make us expect that satisfaction in one thing which we have
   missed in another; but could we once get clearly off, and come to a
   serious and real contempt of worldly things, this were a very
   considerable advancement in our way. The soul of man is of a vigorous
   and active nature, and hath in it a raging and unextinguishable thirst,
   an immaterial kind of fire, always catching at some object or other, in
   conjunction wherewith it thinks to be happy; and were it once rent from
   the world, and all the bewitching enjoyments under the sun, it would
   quickly search after some higher and more excellent object, to satisfy
   its ardent and importunate cravings; and, being no longer dazzled with
   glittering vanities, would fix on that supreme and all-sufficient Good,
   where it would discover such beauty and sweetness as would charm and
   overpower all its affections. The love of the world, and the love of
   God, are like the scales of a balance; as the one falleth, the other
   doth rise: when our natural inclinations prosper, and the creature is
   exalted in our soul, religion is faint, and doth languish; but when
   earthly objects wither away, and lose their beauty, and the soul begins
   to cool and flag in its prosecution of them, then the seeds of grace
   take root, and the divine life begins to flourish and prevail. It doth,
   therefore, nearly concern us, to convince ourselves of the emptiness
   and vanity of creature-enjoyments, and reason our heart out of love
   with them: let us seriously consider all that our reason or our faith,
   our own experience or the observation of others, can suggest to this
   effect: let as ponder the matter over and over, and fix our thoughts on
   this truth, till we become really persuaded of it. Amidst all our
   pursuits and designs, let us stop and ask ourselves, For what end is
   all this? At what do I aim? Can the gross and muddy pleasures of sense,
   or a heap of white and yellow earth, or the esteem and affection of
   silly creatures like myself, satisfy a rational and immortal soul? Have
   I not tried these things already? Will they have a higher relish, and
   yield me more contentment tomorrow than yesterday, or the next year
   than they did the last? There may be some little difference betwixt
   that which I am now pursuing, and that which I enjoyed before; but
   sure, my former enjoyments did show as pleasant and promise as fair,
   before I attained them; like the rainbow, they looked very glorious at
   a distance, but when I approached I found nothing but emptiness and
   vapour. O what a poor thing would the life of man be, if it were
   capable of no higher enjoyments!

   I cannot insist on this subject; and there is the less need when I
   remember to whom I am writing. Yes, my dear friend, you have had as
   great experience of the emptiness and vanity of human things, and have,
   at present, as few worldly engagements as any that I know. I have
   sometimes reflected on those passages of your life wherewith you have
   been pleased to acquaint me; and, methinks, through all, I can discern
   a design of the divine Providence to wean your affections from every
   thing here below. The trials you have had of those things which the
   world dotes upon, have taught you to despise them; and you have found
   by experience, that neither the endowments of nature, nor the
   advantages of fortune, are sufficient for happiness; that every rose
   hath its thorn, and there may be a worm at the foot of the fairest
   gourd; some secret and undiscerned grief, which may make a person
   deserve the pity of those who, perhaps, do admire or envy their
   supposed felicity. If any earthly comforts have got too much of your
   heart, I think they have been your relations and friends; and the
   dearest of these are removed out of the world, so that you must raise
   your mind towards heaven when you would think upon them. Thus, God hath
   provided that your heart may be loosed from the world, and that he may
   not have any rival in your affection, which I have always observed to
   be so large and unbounded, so noble and disinterested, that no inferior
   object can answer or deserve it.

   When we have got our corruptions restrained, and our natural appetites
   and inclinations towards worldly things in some measure subdued, we
   must proceed to take such exercises as have a more immediate tendency
   to excite and awaken the divine life; and, first, let us endeavour
   conscientiously to perform those duties which religion doth require,
   and whereunto it would incline us, if it did prevail in our souls. If
   we cannot get our inward disposition presently charged, let us study at
   least to regulate our outward deportment: if our hearts be not yet
   inflamed with divine love, let us, however, own our allegiance to that
   infinite Majesty, by attending his service and listening to his word,
   by speaking reverently of his name and praising his goodness, and
   exhorting others to serve and obey him. If we want that charity, and
   those bowels of compassion which we ought to have towards our
   neighbours, yet must we not omit any occasion of doing them good: if
   our hearts be haughty and proud, we must, nevertheless study a modest
   and humble deportment. These external performances are of little value
   in themselves, yet they may help us forward to better things. The
   apostle indeed telleth us, "that bodily exercise profiteth little:" but
   he seems not to affirm that it is altogether useless; it is always good
   to be doing what we can, for then God is wont to pity our weakness, and
   assist our feeble endeavours; and when true charity and humility, and
   other graces of the divine Spirit, come to take root in our souls, they
   will exert themselves more freely, and with less difficulty, if we have
   before been accustomed to express them in our outward conversations.
   Nor need we fear the imputation of hypocrisy; though our actions do
   thus somewhat outrun our affections, seeing they do still proceed from
   a sense of our duty; and our design is not to appear better than we
   are, but that we may really become so.

   But as inward acts have a more immediate influence on the soul, to
   mould it to a right temper and frame, so ought we to be most frequent
   and sedulous in the exercise of them. Let us be often lifting up our
   hearts toward God; and if we do not say that we love him above all
   things, let us at least acknowledge, that it is our duty, and would be
   our happiness, so to do: let us lament the dishonour done to him by
   foolish and sinful men, and applaud the praises and adorations that are
   given him by that blessed and glorious company above: let us resign and
   yield ourselves up unto him a thousand times, to be governed by his
   laws, and disposed of at his pleasure; and though our stubborn hearts
   should start back and refuse, yet let us tell him we are convinced that
   his will is always just and good; and, therefore, desire him to do with
   us whatsoever he pleaseth, whether we will or not. And so, for
   begetting in us a universal charity towards men, we must be frequently
   putting up wishes for their happiness, and blessing every person that
   we see; and when we have done any thing for the relief of the
   miserable, we may second it with earnest desires, that God would take
   care of them, and deliver them out of all their distresses.

   Thus should we exercise ourselves unto godliness, and when we are
   employing the powers that we have, the Spirit of God is wont to strike
   in and elevate these acts of our soul beyond the pitch of nature, and
   give them a divine impression; and, after the frequent reiteration of
   these, we shall find ourselves more inclined unto them, they flowing
   with greater freedom and ease.

   I shall mention but two other means for begetting that holy and divine
   temper of spirit which is the subject of the present discourse. And the
   first is, a deep and serious consideration of the truths of our
   religion, and that, both as to the certainty and importance of
   them.--The assent which is ordinarily given to divine truth is very
   faint and languid, very weak and ineffectual, flowing only from a blind
   inclination to follow that religion which is in fashion, or a lazy
   indifferency and unconcernedness whether things be so or not. Men are
   unwilling to quarrel with the religion of their country, and since all
   their neighbours are Christians, they are content to be so too: but
   they are seldom at the pains to consider the evidences of those truths,
   or to ponder the importance and tendency of them; and thence it is that
   they have so little influence on their affections and practice. Those
   "spiritless and paralytic thoughts," (as one doth rightly term them,)
   are not able to move the will, and direct the hand. We must, therefore,
   endeavour to work up our minds to a serious belief and full persuasion
   of divine truths, unto a sense and feeling of spiritual things: our
   thoughts must dwell upon them till we be both convinced of them, and
   deeply affected with them. Let us urge forward our spirits, and make
   them approach the visible world, and fix our minds upon immaterial
   things, till we clearly perceive that these are no dreams; nay, that
   all things are dreams and shadows beside them. When we look about us,
   and behold the beauty and magnificence of this godly frame, the order
   and harmony of the whole creation, let our thoughts from thence take
   their flight towards that omnipotent wisdom and goodness which did at
   first produce, and doth still establish and uphold the same. When we
   reflect upon ourselves, let us consider that we are not a mere piece of
   organized matter, a curious and well-contrived engine; that there is
   more in us than flesh, and blood, and bones, even a divine spark,
   capable to know, and love, and enjoy our Maker; and though it be now
   exceedingly clogged with its dull and lumpish companion, yet ere long
   it shall be delivered, and can subsist without the body, as well as
   that can do without the clothes which we throw off at our pleasure. Let
   us often withdraw our thoughts from this earth, this scene of misery,
   and folly, and sin, and raise them towards that more vast and glorious
   world, whose innocent and blessed inhabitants solace themselves
   eternally in the divine presence, and know no other passions, but an
   unmixed joy and an unbounded love. And then consider how the blessed
   Son of God came down to this lower world to live among us, and die for
   us, that he might bring us to a portion of the same felicity; and think
   how he hath overcome the sharpness of death, and opened the kingdom of
   heaven to all believers, and is now set down on the right hand of the
   Majesty on high, and yet is not the less mindful of us, but receiveth
   our prayers, and presenteth them unto his Father, and is daily visiting
   his church with the influences of his Spirit, as the sun reacheth us
   with his beams.

   The serious and frequent consideration of these, and such other divine
   truths, is the most proper method to beget that lively faith which is
   the foundation of religion, the spring and root of the divine life. Let
   me further suggest some particular subjects of meditation for producing
   the several branches of it. And, first, To inflame our souls with the
   love of God, let us consider the excellency of his nature, and his love
   and kindness towards us. It is little we know of the divine
   perfections; and yet that little may suffice to fill our souls with
   admiration and love, to ravish our affections, as well as to raise our
   wonder; for we are not merely creatures of sense, that we should be
   incapable of any other affection but that which entereth by the eyes.
   The character of any excellent person whom we have never seen, will
   many times engage our hearts, and make us hugely concerned in all his
   interests. And what is it, I pray you, that engages us so much to those
   with whom we converse? I cannot think that is merely the colour of
   their face, in their comely proportions, for then we should fall in
   love with statues, and pictures, and flowers. These outward
   accomplishments may a little delight the eye, but would never be able
   to prevail so much on the heart, if they did not represent some vital
   perfection. We either see or apprehend some greatness of mind, or
   vigour of spirit, or sweetness of disposition; some sprightliness, or
   wisdom, or goodness, which charm our spirit and command our love. Now
   these perfections are not obvious to the sight, the eyes can only
   discern the signs and effects of them; and if it be the understanding
   that directs our affection, and vital perfections prevail with it,
   certainly the excellencies of the divine nature (the traces whereof we
   cannot but discover in every thing we behold) would not fail to engage
   our hearts, if we did seriously view and regard them. Shall we not be
   infinitely more transported with that almighty wisdom and goodness
   which fills the universe, and displays itself in all the parts of the
   creation, which establisheth the frame of nature, and turneth the
   mighty wheels of Providence, and keepeth the world from disorder and
   ruin, than with the faint rays of the very same perfections which we
   meet with in our fellow-creatures? Shall we dote on the sacred pieces
   of a rude and imperfect picture, and never be affected with the
   original beauty; This were an unaccountable stupidity and blindness.
   Whatever we find lovely in a friend, or in a saint, ought not to
   engross, but to elevate our affections: we should conclude with
   ourselves, that if there be so much sweetness in a drop, there must be
   infinitely more in the fountain; if there be so much splendour in a
   ray, what must the sun be in its glory?

   Nor can we pretend the remoteness of the object, as if God were at too
   great a distance for our converse or our love. "He is not far from
   every one of us; for in him we live, move, and have our being." We
   cannot open our eyes, but we must behold some footsteps of his glory;
   and we cannot turn toward him, but we shall be sure to find his intent
   upon us, waiting as it were to catch a look, ready to entertain the
   most intimate fellowship and communion with us. Let us therefore
   endeavour to raise our minds to the clearest conceptions of the divine
   nature. Let us consider all that his works do declare, or his word doth
   discover of him unto us; and let us especially contemplate that visible
   representation of him which was made in our own nature by his Son, who
   was the "brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person,"
   and who appeared in the world to discover at once what God is, and what
   we ought to be. Let us represent him unto our minds as we find him
   described in the gospel, and there we shall behold the perfections of
   the divine nature, though covered with the vail of human infirmities;
   and when we have framed unto ourselves the clearest notion that we can
   of a Being infinite in power, in wisdom, and goodness, the Author and
   fountain of all perfections, let us fix the eyes of our souls upon it,
   that our eyes may affect our heart--and while we are musing the fire
   will burn.

   Especially, if we hereunto add the consideration of God's favour and
   good-will towards us; nothing is more powerful to engage our affection,
   than to find that we are beloved. Expressions of kindness are always
   pleasing and acceptable unto us, though the person should be otherwise
   mean and contemptible; but to have the love of one who is altogether
   lovely, to know that the glorious Majesty of heaven hath any regard
   unto us, how must it astonish and delight us, how must it overcome our
   spirits, and melt our hearts, and put our whole soul into a flame! Now,
   as the word of God is full of the expressions of his love towards men,
   so all his works do loudly proclaim it. He gave us our being, and, by
   preserving us in it, doth renew the donation every moment. He hath
   placed us in a rich and well-furnished world, and liberally provided
   for all our necessities. He raineth down blessings from heaven upon us,
   and causeth the earth to bring forth our provision. He giveth us our
   food and raiment, and while we are spending the productions of one
   year, he is preparing for us against another. He sweeteneth our lives
   with innumerable comforts, and gratifieth every faculty with suitable
   objects. The eye of his providence is always upon us, and he watcheth
   for our safety when we are fast asleep, neither minding him nor
   ourselves. But, lest we should think these testimonies of his kindness
   less considerable, because they are the easy issues of his omnipotent
   power, and do not put him to any trouble or pain, he hath taken a more
   wonderful method to endear himself to us: he hath testified his
   affection to us by suffering as well as by doing; and because he could
   not suffer in his own nature he assumed ours. The eternal Son of God
   did clothe himself with the infirmities of our flesh, and left the
   company of those innocent and blessed spirits who knew well how to love
   and adore him, that he might dwell among men, and wrestle with the
   obstinacy of that rebellious race, to reduce them to their allegiance
   and felicity, and then to offer himself up as a sacrifice and
   propitiation for them. I remember one of the poets hath an ingenious
   fancy to express the passion wherewith he found himself overcome after
   a long resistance: that the god of love had shot all his golden arrows
   at him, but could never pierce his heart, till at length he put himself
   into the bow, and darted himself straight into his breast. Methinks
   this doth some way adumbrate God's method of dealing with men. He had
   long contended with a stubborn world, and thrown down many a blessing
   upon them; and when all his other gifts could not prevail, he at last
   made a gift of himself, to testify his affection and engage theirs. The
   account which we have of our Saviour's life in the gospel, doth all
   along present us with the story of his love: all the pains that he
   took, and the troubles that he endured, were the wonderful effects and
   uncontrollable evidences of it. But, O that last, that dismal scene! Is
   it possible to remember it, and question his kindness, or deny him
   ours? Here, here it is, my dear friend, that we should fix our most
   serious and solemn thoughts, "that Christ may dwell in our hearts by
   faith; that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to
   comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
   and heighth; and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,
   that we may be filled with all the fulness of God."

   We ought also frequently to reflect on those particular tokens of
   favour and love, which God hath bestowed on ourselves; how long he hath
   borne with our follies and sins, and waited to be gracious unto
   us--wrestling, as it were, with the stubbornness of our hearts, and
   essaying every method to reclaim us. We should keep a register in our
   minds of all the eminent blessings and deliverances we have met with,
   some whereof have been so conveyed, that we might clearly perceive they
   were not the issues of chance, but the gracious effects of the divine
   favour, and the signal returns of our prayers. Nor ought we to imbitter
   the thoughts of these things with any harsh or unworthy suspicions, as
   if they were designed on purpose to enhance our guilt, and heighten our
   eternal damnation. No, no, my friend, God is love, and he hath no
   pleasure in the ruin of his creatures. If they abuse his goodness, and
   turn his grace into wantonness, and thereby plunge themselves into the
   greater depth of guilt and misery, this is the effect of their
   obstinate wickedness, and not the design of those benefits which he
   bestows.

   If these considerations had once begotten in our hearts a real love and
   affection towards almighty God, that would easily lead us unto the
   other branches of religion; and, therefore, I shall need say the less
   of them.

   We shall find our hearts enlarged in charity toward men, by considering
   the relation wherein they stand unto God, and the impresses of his
   image which are stamped upon them. They are not only his creatures, the
   workmanship of his hands, but such of whom he taketh special care, and
   for whom he hath a very dear and tender regard, having laid the designs
   of their happiness before the foundations of the world, and being
   willing to live and converse with them in all the ages of eternity. The
   meanest and most contemptible person whom we behold is the offspring of
   heaven, one of the children of the Most High; and however unworthy he
   might behave himself of that relation, so long as God hath not
   abdicated and disowned him by a final sentence, he will have us to
   acknowledge him as one of him, and as such to embrace him with a
   sincere and cordial affection. You know what a great concernment we are
   wont to have for those that do any ways belong to the person whom we
   love; how gladly we lay hold on every opportunity to gratify the child
   or servant of a friend; and sure our love towards God would as
   naturally spring forth in charity towards men, did we mind the interest
   that he is pleased to take in them, and consider that every soul is
   dearer unto him than all the material world; and that he did not
   account the blood of his Son too great a price for their redemption.

   Again, as all men stand in a near relation to God, so they have still
   so much of his image stamped on them as may oblige and excite us to
   love them. In some, this image is more eminent and conspicuous, and we
   can discern the lovely traces of wisdom and goodness; and though in
   others it may be miserably sullied and defaced, yet it is not
   altogether razed--some lineaments at least do still remain. All men are
   endowed with rational and immortal souls, with understandings and wills
   capable of the highest and most exalted things; and if they be at
   present disordered, and put out of tune by wickedness and folly, this
   may indeed move our compassion, but ought not, in reason, to extinguish
   our love. When we see a person of a rugged humour and perverse
   disposition, full of malice and dissimulation, very foolish and very
   proud, it is hard to fall in love with an object that presents itself
   unto us under an idea so little grateful and lovely. But when we shall
   consider these evil qualities as the diseases and distempers of a soul,
   which, in itself, is capable of all that wisdom and goodness wherewith
   the best of saints have ever been adorned, and which may, one day, come
   to be raised to such heights of perfection as shall render it a fit
   companion for the holy angels; this will turn our aversion into pity,
   and make us behold him with such resentments as we should have when we
   look upon a beautiful body that were mangled with wounds, or disfigured
   by some loathsome disease; and however we hate the vices, we shall not
   cease to love the man.

   In the next place, for purifying our souls, and disentangling our
   affections from the pleasures and enjoyments of this lower life, let us
   frequently ponder the excellency and dignity of our nature, and what a
   shameful and unworthy thing it is for so noble and divine a creature as
   the soul of man, to be sunk and immersed in brutish and sensual lusts,
   or amused with airy and fantastical delights, and so to lose the relish
   of solid and spiritual pleasures; that the best should be fed and
   pampered, and the man and the Christian be starved in us. Did we but
   mind who we are, and for what we were made, this would teach us, in a
   right sense, to reverence and stand in awe of ourselves; it would beget
   a modesty and shamefacedness, and make us very shy and reserved in the
   use of the most innocent and allowable pleasures.

   It will be very effectual to the same purpose, that we frequently raise
   our minds towards heaven, and represent to our thoughts the joys that
   are at God's right hand, those pleasures that endure for evermore; "for
   every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is
   pure." If our heavenly country be much in our thoughts, it will make us
   as "strangers and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war
   against the soul," and keep ourselves unspotted from this world, that
   we may be fit for the enjoyments and felicities of the other. But then
   we must see that our notions of heaven be not gross and carnal, that we
   dream not of a Mahometan paradise, nor rest on those metaphors and
   similitudes by which these joys are sometimes represented: for this
   might perhaps have a quite contrary effect; it might entangle us
   farther in carnal affections, and we should be ready to indulge
   ourselves in a very liberal foretaste of those pleasures wherein we had
   placed our everlasting felicity. But when we come once to conceive
   aright of those pure and spiritual pleasures; when the happiness we
   propose to ourselves is from the sight, and love, and enjoyment of God,
   and our minds are filled with the hopes and forethoughts of that
   blessed estate; O how mean and contemptible will all things here below
   appear in our eyes! With what disdain shall we reject the gross and
   muddy pleasures that would deprive us of those celestial enjoyments, or
   any way unfit and indispose us for them!

   The last branch of religion is humility, and sure we can never want
   matter of consideration for begetting it. All our wickednesses and
   imperfections, all our follies and our sins, may help to pull down that
   fond and overweening conceit which we are apt to entertain of
   ourselves. That which makes any body esteem us, is their knowledge or
   apprehension of some little good, and their ignorance of a great deal
   of evil that may be in us; were they thoroughly acquainted with us,
   they would quickly change their opinion. The thoughts that pass in our
   hearts, in the best and most serious day of our life, being exposed
   unto public view, would render us either hateful or ridiculous. And
   now, however we conceal our failings from one another, yet sure we are
   conscious of them ourselves, and some serious reflections upon them
   would much qualify and allay the vanity of our spirits. Thus holy men
   have come really to think worse of themselves, than of any other person
   in the world: not but that they knew that gross and scandalous vices
   are, in their nature, more heinous than the surprisals of temptations
   and infirmity; but because they were much more intent on their own
   miscarriages than on those of their neighbours, and did consider all
   the aggravations of the one, and every thing that might be supposed to
   diminish and alleviate the other.

   But it is well observed by a pious writer, that the deepest and most
   pure humility doth not so much arise from the consideration of our own
   faults and defects, as from a calm and quiet contemplation of the
   divine purity and goodness. Our spots never appear so clearly, as when
   we place them before this infinite light; and we never seem less in our
   own eyes, than when we look down upon ourselves from on high. O how
   little, how nothing, do all these shadows of perfection then appear,
   for which we are wont to value ourselves! That humility, which cometh
   from a view of our own sinfulness and misery, is more turbulent and
   boisterous; but the other layeth us full as low, and wanteth nothing of
   that anguish and vexation wherewith our souls are apt to boil, when
   they are the nearest objects of our thoughts.

   There remains yet another means for begetting a holy and religious
   disposition in the soul, and that is, fervent and hearty prayer.
   Holiness is the gift of God--indeed the greatest gift he doth bestow,
   or we are capable to recieve; and he hath promised his Holy Spirit to
   those who ask it of him. In prayer we make the nearest approaches to
   God, and lie open to the influences of heaven; then it is that the Sun
   of Righteousness doth visit us with his directest rays, and dissipateth
   our darkness, and imprinteth his image on our souls. I cannot now
   insist on the advantages of this exercise, or the disposition wherewith
   it ought to be performed; and there is no need I should, there being so
   many books that treat on this subject. I shall only tell you, that as
   there is one sort of prayer wherein we make use of the voice, which is
   necessary in public, and may sometimes have its own advantages in
   private; and another, wherein though we utter no sound, yet we conceive
   the expressions, and form the words, as it were, in our minds; so there
   is a third and more sublime kind of prayer, wherein the soul takes a
   higher flight, and having collected all its forces by long and serious
   meditation, it darteth itself (if I may so speak) towards God in sighs
   and groans, and thoughts too big for expression. As when, after a deep
   contemplation of the divine perfections appearing in all his works of
   wonder, it addresseth itself unto him in the profoundest adoration of
   his majesty and glory: for, when after sad reflections on its vileness
   and miscarriages, it prostrates itself before him with the greatest
   confusion and sorrow, not daring to lift up its eyes, or utter one word
   in his presence; or when, having well considered the beauty of
   holiness, and the unspeakable felicity of those that are truly good, it
   panteth after God, and sendeth up such vigorous and ardent desires as
   no words can sufficiently express, continuing and repeating each of
   these acts, as long as it finds itself upheld by the force and impulse
   of the previous meditation.

   This mental prayer is of all others the most effectual to purify the
   soul, and dispose it unto a holy and religious temper, and may be
   termed the great secret of devotion, and one of the most powerful
   instruments of the divine life; and, it may be, the apostle hath a
   peculiar respect unto it, when he saith, that "the Spirit helpeth our
   infirmities, making intercession for us with groanings that cannot be
   uttered," or, as the original may bear, "that cannot be worded." Yet I
   do not so recommend this sort of prayer, as to supersede the use of the
   other; for we have so many several things to pray for, and every
   petition of this nature requireth so much time, and so great an
   attention of spirit, that it were not easy therein to overtake them
   all: to say nothing, that the deep sighs and heavings of the heart,
   which are wont to accompany it, are something oppressive to nature, and
   make it hard to continue long in them. But certainly a few of these
   inward aspirations will do more than a great many fluent and melting
   expressions.


   Thus, my dear friend, I have briefly proposed the method which I judge
   proper for moulding the soul into a holy frame; and the same means
   which serve to beget this divine temper, must still be practiced for
   strengthening and advancing it: and therefore I shall recommend but one
   more for that purpose, and it is the frequent and conscientious use of
   that holy sacrament, which is peculiarly appointed to nourish and
   increase spiritual life, when once it is begun in the soul. All the
   instruments of religion do meet together in this ordinance; and while
   we address ourselves unto it, we are put to practice all the rules
   which were mentioned before. Then it is that we make the severest
   survey of our actions, and lay the strictest obligations on ourselves;
   then are our minds raised up to the highest contempt of the world, and
   every grace doth exercise itself with the greatest activity and vigour;
   all the subjects of contemplation do there present themselves unto us
   with the greatest advantage; and then, if ever, doth the soul make its
   most powerful sallies toward heaven, and assault it with a holy and
   acceptable force. And certainly the neglect or careless performance of
   this duty, is one of the chief causes that bedwarfs our religion, and
   makes us continue of so low a size.

   But it is time I should put a close to this letter, which is grown to a
   far greater bulk than at first intended. If these poor papers can do
   you the smallest service, I shall think myself very happy in this
   undertaking; at least I am hopeful you will kindly accept the sincere
   endeavors of a person who would fain acquit himself of some part of
   that which he owes you.

   ### A PRAYER.

   And now, O most gracious God, Father and Fountain of mercy and
   goodness, who has blessed us with the knowledge of our happiness, and
   the way that leadeth unto it! excite in our souls such ardent desires
   after the one, as may put us forth to the diligent prosecution of the
   other. Let us neither presume on our own strength, nor distrust thy
   divine assistance: but while we are doing our utmost endeavours, teach
   us still to depend on thee for success. Open our eyes, O God, and teach
   us out of thy law. Bless us with an exact and tender sense of our duty,
   and a knowledge to discern perverse things. O that our ways were
   directed to keep thy statutes, then shall we not be ashamed when we
   have respect unto all thy commandments. Possess our hearts with a
   generous and holy disdain of all those poor enjoyments which this world
   holdeth out to allure us, that they may never be able to inveigle our
   affections, or betray us to any sin: turn away our eyes from beholding
   vanity, and quicken thou us in thy law. Fill our souls with such a deep
   sense, and full persuasion of those great truths which thou hast
   revealed in the gospel, as may influence and regulate our whole
   conversation; and that the life which we henceforth live in the flesh,
   we may life through faith in the Son of God. O that the infinite
   perfections of thy blessed nature, and the astonishing expressions of
   thy goodness and love, may conquer and overpower our hearts, that they
   may be constantly rising toward thee in flames of devoutest affection,
   and enlarging themselves in sincere and cordial love towards all the
   world for thy sake; and that we may cleanse ourselves from all
   filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in thy fear,
   without which we can never hope to behold and enjoy thee. Finally, O
   God! grant that the consideration of what thou art, and what we
   ourselves are, may both humble and lay us low before thee, and also
   stir up in us the strongest and most ardent aspiration towards thee. We
   desire to resign and give up ourselves to the conduct of thy Holy
   Spirit; lead us in thy truth, and teach us, for thou art the God of our
   salvation; guide us with thy counsel, and afterwards recieve us unto
   glory, for the merits and intercession of thy blessed Son our Saviour.
   Amen.
