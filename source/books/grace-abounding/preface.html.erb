<h3 align="center">A PREFACE</h3>
<h4 align="center">OR BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PUBLISHING OF THIS
WORK</h4>
<p>WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR THEREOF, AND DEDICATED TO THOSE WHOM GOD
HATH COUNTED HIM WORTHY TO BEGET TO FAITH, BY HIS MINISTRY IN THE
WORD</p>
<p>CHILDREN, grace be with you, Amen. I being taken from you in
presence, and so tied up, that I cannot perform that duty that from
God doth lie upon me to youward, for your further edifying and
building up in faith and holiness, etc., yet that you may see my
soul hath fatherly care and desire after your spiritual and
everlasting welfare; I now once again, as before, from the top of
Shenir and Hermon, so now from the lions' dens, from the mountains
of the leopards (S.of Sol. 4.8), do look yet after you all, greatly
longing to see your safe arrival into the desired haven.</p>
<p>I thank God upon every remembrance of you; and rejoice, even
while I stick between the teeth of the lions in the wilderness, at
the grace, and mercy, and knowledge of Christ our Saviour, which
God hath bestowed upon you, with abundance of faith and love. Your
hungerings and thirstings also after further acquaintance with the
Father, in His Son; your tenderness of heart, your trembling at
sin, your sober and holy deportment also, before both God and men,
is great refreshment to me; 'For ye are my glory and joy' (1 Thess.
2.20).</p>
<p>I have sent you here enclosed, a drop of that honey, that I have
taken out of the carcase of a lion ( Judg. 14.5-9). I have eaten
thereof myself also, and am much refreshed thereby. (Temptations,
when we meet them at first, are as the lion that roared upon
Samson; but if we overcome them, the next time we see them, we
shall find a nest of honey within them.) The Philistines understand
me not. It is something of a relation of the work of God upon my
own soul, even from the very first, till now; wherein you may
perceive my castings down, and raisings up; for he woundeth, and
his hands make whole. It is written in the Scripture ( Isa. 38.19),
'The father to the children shall make known the truth of God.'
Yea, it was for this reason I lay so long at Sinai ( Deut. 4.10,
11), to see the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, that I might
fear the Lord all the days of my life upon earth, and tell of his
wondrous works to my children ( Ps. 78.3-5).</p>
<p>Moses ( Num. 33.1, 2) writ of the journeyings of the children of
Israel, from Egypt to the land of Canaan; and commanded also, that
they did remember their forty years' travel in the wilderness.
'Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove
thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep
his commandments, or no' ( Deut. 8.2). Wherefore this I have
endeavoured to do; and not only so, but to publish it also; that,
if God will, others may be put in remembrance of what He hath done
for their souls, by reading His work upon me.</p>
<p>It is profitable for Christians to be often calling to mind the
very beginnings of grace with their souls. 'It is a night to be
much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of
Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the
children of Israel in their generations' ( Ex. 12.42). 'O my God,'
saith David ( Ps. 42.6), 'my soul is cast down within me; therefore
will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the
Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.' He remembered also the lion and
the bear, when he went to fight with the giant of Gath ( I Sam.
17.36, 37).</p>
<p>It was Paul's accustomed manner ( Acts 22), and that when tried
for his life (Acts 24), ever to open, before his judges, the manner
of his conversion: he would think of that day, and that hour, in
the which he first did meet with grace; for he found it support
unto him. When God had brought the children of Israel through the
Red Sea, far into the wilderness, yet they must turn quite about
thither again, to remember the drowning of their enemies there (
Num.14.25). For though they sang His praise before, yet 'they soon
forgat his works' ( Ps. 106.11-13).</p>
<p>In this discourse of mine you may see much; much, I say, of the
grace of God towards me. I thank God I can count it much, for it
was above my sins and Satan's temptations too. I can remember my
fears, and doubts, and sad months with comfort; they are as the
head of Goliath in my hand. There was nothing to David like
Goliath's sword, even that sword that should have been sheathed in
his bowels; for the very sight and remembrance of that did preach
forth God's deliverance to him. Oh, the remembrance of my great
sins, of my great temptations, and of my great fears of perishing
for ever! They bring afresh into my mind the remembrance of my
great help, my great support from heaven, and the great grace that
God extended to such a wretch as I.</p>
<p>My dear children, call to mind the former days, and the years of
ancient times: remember also your songs in the night; and commune
with your own heart ( Ps. 77.5-12). Yea, look diligently, and leave
no corner therein unsearched, for there is treasure hid, even the
treasure of your first and second experience of the grace of God
toward you. Remember, I say, the word that first laid hold upon
you; remember your terrors of conscience, and fear of death and
hell; remember also your tears and prayers to God; yea, how you
sighed under every hedge for mercy. Have you never a hill Mizar to
remember? Have you forgot the close, the milk house, the stable,
the barn, and the like, where God did visit your soul? Remember
also the Word-the Word, I say, upon which the Lord hath caused you
to hope. If you have sinned against light; if you are tempted to
blaspheme; if you are down in despair; if you think God fights
against you; or if heaven is hid from your eyes, remember it was
thus with your father, but out of them all the Lord delivered
me.</p>
<p>I could have enlarged much in this my discourse, of my
temptations and troubles for sin; as also of the merciful kindness
and working of God with my soul. I could also have stepped into a
style much higher than this in which I have here discoursed, and
could have adorned all things more than here I have seemed to do,
but I dare not. God did not play in convincing of me, the devil did
not play in tempting of me, neither did I play when I sunk as into
a bottomless pit, when the pangs of hell caught hold upon me;
wherefore I may not play in my relating of them, but be plain and
simple, and lay down the thing as it was. He that liketh it, let
him receive it; and he that does not, let him produce a better.
Farewell.</p>
<p>My dear children, the milk and honey is beyond this wilderness,
God be merciful to you, and grant that you be not slothful to go in
to possess the land.</p>
