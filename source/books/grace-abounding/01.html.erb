<h2>GRACE ABOUNDING TO THE CHIEF OF SINNERS</h2>
<h3>A BRIEF RELATION OF THE EXCEEDING MERCY OF GOD IN CHRIST, TO HIS
  POOR SERVANT, JOHN BUNYAN</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this my relation of the merciful
working of God upon my soul, it will not be amiss, if in the
first place, I do in a few words give you a hint of my pedigree,
and manner of bringing up; that thereby the goodness and bounty
of God towards me, may be the more advanced and magnified before
the sons of men.</p>
<p><a href="#l2" id="l2">2</a>.&nbsp; For my descent then, it was, as is well known by
many, of a low and inconsiderable generation; my father&rsquo;s
house being of that rank that is meanest, and most despised of
all the families in the land.&nbsp; Wherefore, I have not here,
as others, to boast of noble blood, or of any high-born state,
according to the flesh; though, all things considered, I magnify
the heavenly Majesty, for that by this door He brought me into
the world, to partake of the grace and life that is in Christ by
the gospel.</p>
<p><a href="#l3" id="l3">3</a>.&nbsp; But yet, notwithstanding the meanness and
inconsiderableness of my parents, it pleased God to put it into
their hearts, to put me to school, to learn both to read and
write; the which I also attained, according to the rate of other
poor men&rsquo;s children: though, to my shame, I confess, I did
soon lose that I had learned, even almost utterly, and that long
before the Lord did work His gracious work of conversion upon my
soul.</p>
<p><a href="#l4" id="l4">4</a>.&nbsp; As for my own natural life, for the time that I was
without God in the world, it was, indeed, <i>according to the
course of this world and the spirit that now worketh in the
children of disobedience</i>.&nbsp; Eph. ii. 2, 3.&nbsp; It was
my delight to be &lsquo;taken captive by the devil <i>at his
will</i>,&rsquo; 2 Tim. ii. 26; being filled with all
unrighteousness; the which did also so strongly work, and put
forth itself, both in my heart and life, and that from a child,
that I had but few equals (especially considering my years, which
were tender, being but few) both for cursing, swearing, lying,
and blaspheming the holy name of God.</p>
<p><a href="#l5" id="l5">5</a>.&nbsp; Yea, so settled and rooted was I in these things,
that they became as a second nature to me; the which, as I have
also with soberness considered since, did so offend the Lord,
that even in my childhood he did scare and affrighten me with
fearful dreams, and did terrify me with fearful visions.&nbsp;
For often, after I have spent this and the other day in sin, I
have in my bed been greatly afflicted, while asleep, with the
apprehensions of devils and wicked spirits, who still, as I then
thought, laboured to draw me away with them, of which I could
never be rid.</p>
<p><a href="#l6" id="l6">6</a>.&nbsp; Also I should, at these years, be greatly afflicted
and troubled with the thoughts of the fearful torments of
hell-fire; still fearing, that it would be my lot to be found at
last among those devils and hellish fiends, who are there bound
down with the chains and bonds of darkness, unto the judgment of
the great day.</p>
<p><a href="#l7" id="l7">7</a>.&nbsp; These things, I say, when I was but a child, but nine
or ten years old, did so distress my soul, that then in the midst
of my many sports and childish vanities, amidst my vain
companions, I was often much cast down, and afflicted in my mind
therewith, yet could I not let go my sins: yea, I was also then
so overcome with despair of life and heaven, that I should often
wish, either that there had been no hell, or that I had been a
devil; supposing they were only tormentors; that if it must needs
be, that I went thither, I might be rather a tormentor, than be
tormented myself.</p>
<p><a href="#l8" id="l8">8</a>. A while after those terrible dreams did leave me, which
also I soon forgot; for my pleasures did quickly cut off the
remembrance of them, as if they had never been: wherefore with
more greediness, according to the strength of nature, I did still
let loose the reins of my lust, and delighted in all
transgressions against the law of God: so that until I came to
the state of marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the youth
that kept me company, in all manner of vice and ungodliness.</p>
<p><a href="#l9" id="l9">9</a>.&nbsp; Yea, such prevalency had the lusts and fruits of the
flesh in this poor soul of mine, that had not a miracle of
precious grace prevented, I had not only perished by the stroke
of eternal justice, but had also laid myself open, even to the
stroke of those laws which bring some to disgrace and open shame
before the face of the world.</p>
<p><a href="#l10" id="l10">10</a>.&nbsp; In these days the thoughts of religion were very
grievous to me; I could neither endure it myself, nor that any
other should; so that when I have seen some read in those books
that concerned Christian piety, it would be as it were a prison
to me.&nbsp; <i>Then I said unto God</i>, <i>Depart from me</i>,
<i>for I desire not the knowledge of Thy ways</i>.&nbsp; Job xxi.
14, 15.&nbsp; I was now void of all good consideration, heaven
and hell were both out of sight and mind; and as for saving and
damning, they were least in my thoughts.&nbsp; <i>O Lord</i>,
<i>Thou knowest my life</i>, <i>and my ways were not hid from
Thee</i>!</p>
<p><a href="#l11" id="l11">11</a>.&nbsp; But this I well remember, that though I could myself
sin with the greatest delight and ease, and also take pleasure in
the vileness of my companions; yet, even then, if I had at any
time seen wicked things, by those who professed goodness, it
would make my spirit tremble.&nbsp; As once above all the rest,
when I was in the height of vanity, yet hearing one to swear,
that was reckoned for a religious man, it had so great a stroke
upon my spirit, that it made my heart ache.</p>
<p><a href="#l12" id="l12">12</a>.&nbsp; But God did not utterly leave me, but followed me
still, not now with convictions, but judgments; yet such as were
mixed with mercy.&nbsp; For once I fell into a creek of the sea,
and hardly escaped drowning.&nbsp; Another time I fell out of a
boat into <i>Bedford</i> river, but, mercy yet preserved me
alive: besides, another time, being in a field, with one of my
companions, it chanced that an adder passed over the highway, so
I having a stick in my hand, struck her over the back; and having
stunned her, I forced open her mouth with my stick, and plucked
her sting out with my fingers; by which act had not God been
merciful unto me, I might by my desperateness, have brought
myself to my end.</p>
<p><a href="#l13" id="l13">13</a>.&nbsp; This also I have taken notice of, with thanksgiving:
When I was a soldier, I with others, were drawn out to go to such
a place to besiege it; but when I was just ready to go, one of
the company desired to go in my room: to which, when I had
consented, he took my place; and coming to the siege, as he stood
sentinel, he was shot in the head with a musket-bullet and
died.</p>
<p><a href="#l14" id="l14">14</a>.&nbsp; Here, as I said, were judgments and mercy, but
neither of them did awaken my soul to righteousness; wherefore I
sinned still, and grew more and more rebellious against God, and
careless of my own salvation.</p>
<p><a href="#l15" id="l15">15</a>.&nbsp; Presently after this, I changed my condition into a
married state, and my mercy was, to light upon a wife whose
father was counted godly: This woman and I, though we came
together as poor as poor might be (not having so much household
stuff as a dish or a spoon betwixt us both), yet this she had for
her part: <i>The Plain Man&rsquo;s Pathway to Heaven</i> and
<i>The Practice of Piety</i>; which her father had left her when
he died.&nbsp; In these two books I would sometimes read with
her, wherein I also found some things that were somewhat pleasing
to me (but all this while I met with no conviction).&nbsp; She
also would be often telling of me what a godly man her father
was, and how he would reprove and correct vice, both in his
house, and among his neighbours; what a strict and holy life he
lived in his days, both in word and deed.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="#l16" id="l16">16</a>.&nbsp; Wherefore these books, with this relation, though
they did not reach my heart, to awaken it about my sad and sinful
state, yet they did beget within me some desires to religion: so
that because I knew no better, I fell in very eagerly with the
religion of the times; to wit, to go to church twice a day, and
that too with the foremost; and there should very devoutly, both
say and sing, as others did, yet retaining my wicked life; but
withal, I was so over-run with the spirit of superstition, that I
adored, and that with great devotion, even all things (both the
high-place, priest, clerk, vestment, service, and what else)
belonging to the church; counting all things holy that were
therein contained, and especially, the priest and clerk most
happy, and without doubt, greatly blessed, because they were the
servants, as I then thought, of God, and were principal in the
holy temple, to do His work therein.</p>
<p><a href="#l17" id="l17">17</a>.&nbsp; This conceit grew so strong in a little time upon my
spirit, that had I but seen a priest (though never so sordid and
debauched in his life), I should find my spirit fall under him,
reverence him, and knit unto him; yea, I thought, for the love I
did bear unto them (supposing them the ministers of God), I could
have laid down at their feet, and have been trampled upon by
them; their name, their garb, and work did so intoxicate and
bewitch me.</p>
<p><a href="#l18" id="l18">18</a>.&nbsp; After I had been thus for some considerable time,
another thought came in my mind; and that was, whether we were of
the <i>Israelites</i> or no?&nbsp; For finding in the scripture
that they were once the peculiar people of God, thought I, if I
were one of this race, my soul must needs be happy.&nbsp; Now
again, I found within me a great longing to be resolved about
this question, but could not tell how I should: at last I asked
my father of it; who told me, <i>No</i>, <i>we were
not</i>.&nbsp; Wherefore then I fell in my spirit, as to the
hopes of that, and so remained.</p>
<p><a href="#l19" id="l19">19</a>.&nbsp; But all this while, I was not sensible of the danger
and evil of sin; I was kept from considering that sin would damn
me, what religion soever I followed, unless I was found in
Christ: nay, I never thought of Him, or whether there was such a
One, or no.&nbsp; <i>Thus man</i>, <i>while blind</i>, <i>doth
wander</i>, <i>but wearieth himself with vanity</i>, <i>for he
knoweth not the way to the city of God</i>.&nbsp; Eccles. x.
15.</p>
<p><a href="#l20" id="l20">20</a>.&nbsp; But one day (amongst all the sermons our parson
made) his subject was, to treat of the Sabbath day, and of the
evil of breaking that, either with labour, sports or
otherwise.&nbsp; (Now, I was, notwithstanding my religion, one
that took much delight in all manner of vice, and especially that
was the day that I did solace myself therewith): wherefore I fell
in my conscience under his sermon, thinking and believing that he
made that sermon on purpose to show me my evil doing.&nbsp; And
at that time I felt what guilt was, though never before, that I
can remember; but then I was, for the present, greatly loaden
therewith, and so went home when the sermon was ended, with a
great burthen upon my spirit.</p>
<p><a href="#l21" id="l21">21</a>.&nbsp; This, for that instant did benumb the sinews of my
best delights, and did imbitter my former pleasures to me; but
hold, it lasted not, for before I had well dined, the trouble
began to go off my mind, and my heart returned to its old course:
but oh! how glad was I, that this trouble was gone from me, and
that the fire was put out, that I might sin again without
control!&nbsp; Wherefore, when I had satisfied nature with my
food, I shook the sermon out of my mind, and to my old custom of
sports and gaming, I returned with great delight.</p>
<p><a href="#l22" id="l22">22</a>.&nbsp; But the same day, as I was in the midst of a game of
Cat, and having struck it one blow from the hole, just as I was
about to strike it the second time, a voice did suddenly dart
from heaven into my soul, which said, <i>Wilt thou leave thy sins
and go to heaven</i>, <i>or have thy sins and go to
hell</i>?&nbsp; At this I was put to an exceeding maze; wherefore
leaving my cat upon the ground, I looked up to heaven, and was,
as if I had, with the eyes of my understanding, seen the Lord
Jesus looking down upon me, as being very hotly displeased with
me, and as if He did severely threaten me with some grievous
punishment for these and other ungodly practices.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="#l23" id="l23">23</a>.&nbsp; I had no sooner thus conceived in my mind, but,
suddenly, this conclusion was fastened on my spirit (for the
former hint did set my sins again before my face), <i>That I had
been a great and grievous sinner</i>, <i>and that it was now too
late for me to look after heaven</i>; <i>for Christ would not
forgive me</i>, <i>nor pardon my transgressions</i>.&nbsp; Then I
fell to musing on this also; and while I was thinking of it, and
fearing lest it should be so; I felt my heart sink in despair,
concluding it was too late; and therefore I resolved in my mind I
would go on in sin: for, thought I, if the case be thus, my state
is surely miserable; miserable if I leave my sins, and but
miserable if I follow them; I can but be damned, and if I must be
so, I had as good be damned for many sins, as be damned for
few.</p>
<p><a href="#l24" id="l24">24</a>.&nbsp; Thus I stood in the midst of my play, before all
that then were present: but yet I told them nothing: but I say;
having made this conclusion, I returned desperately to my sport
again; and I well remember, that presently this kind of despair
did so possess my soul, that I was persuaded I could never attain
to other comfort than what I should get in sin; for heaven was
gone already, so that on that I must not think; wherefore I found
within me great desire to take my fill of sin, still studying
what sin was yet to be committed, that I might taste the
sweetness of it; and I made as much haste as I could to fill my
belly with its delicates, lest I should die before I had my
desire; for that I feared greatly.&nbsp; In these things, I
protest before God, I lye not, neither do I feign this form of
speech; these were really, strongly, and with all my heart, my
desires: <i>The good Lord</i>, <i>Whose mercy is
unsearchable</i>, <i>forgive me my transgressions</i>!</p>
<p><a href="#l25" id="l25">25</a>.&nbsp; And I am very confident, that this temptation of the
devil is more usual among poor creatures, than many are aware of,
even to over-run the spirits with a scurvy and seared frame of
heart, and benumbing of conscience, which frame he stilly and
slily supplieth with such despair, that, though not much guilt
attendeth souls, yet they continually have a secret conclusion
within them, that there is no hope for them; <i>for they have
loved sins</i>, <i>therefore after them they will go</i>.&nbsp;
Jer. ii. 25, and xviii. 12.</p>
<p><a href="#l26" id="l26">26</a>.&nbsp; Now therefore I went on in sin with great greediness
of mind, still grudging that I could not be so satisfied with it,
as I would.&nbsp; This did continue with me about a month, or
more; but one day, as I was standing at a neighbour&rsquo;s shop
window, and there cursing and swearing, and playing the madman,
after my wonted manner, there sate within, the woman of the
house, and heard me; who, though she also was a very loose and
ungodly wretch, yet protested that I swore and cursed at that
most fearful rate, that she was made to tremble to hear me; and
told me further, <i>that I was the ungodliest fellow for
swearing</i>, <i>that she ever heard in all her life</i>; <i>and
that I</i>, <i>by thus doing</i>, <i>was able to spoil all the
youth in the whole town</i>, <i>if they come but in my
company</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l27" id="l27">27</a>.&nbsp; At this reproof I was silenced, and put to secret
shame; and that too, as I thought, before the God of heaven;
wherefore, while I stood there, and hanging down my head, I
wished with all my heart that I might be a little child again,
that my father might learn me to speak without this wicked way of
swearing; for, thought I, I am so accustomed to it, that it is in
vain for me to think of a reformation; for I thought it could
never be.</p>
<p><a href="#l28" id="l28">28</a>.&nbsp; But how it came to pass, I know not; I did from this
time forward, so leave my swearing, that it was a great wonder to
myself to observe it; and whereas before I knew not how to speak
unless I put an oath before, and another behind, to make my words
have authority; now I could, without it, speak better, and with
more pleasantness than ever I could before.&nbsp; All this while
I knew not Jesus Christ, neither did I leave my sports and
plays.</p>
<p><a href="#l29" id="l29">29</a>.&nbsp; But quickly after this, I fell into company with one
poor man that made profession of religion; who, as I then
thought, did talk pleasantly of the scriptures, and of the
matters of religion; wherefore falling into some love and liking
to what he said, I betook me to my Bible, and began to take great
pleasure in reading, but especially with the historical part
thereof; for as for Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, and such like
scriptures, I could not away with them, being as yet ignorant,
either of the corruptions of my nature, or of the want and worth
of Jesus Christ to save me.</p>
<p><a href="#l30" id="l30">30</a>.&nbsp; Wherefore I fell to some outward reformation both in
my words and life, and did set the commandments before me for my
way to heaven; which commandments I also did strive to keep, and,
as I thought, did keep them pretty well sometimes, and then I
should have comfort; yet now and then should break one, and so
afflict my conscience; but then I should repent, and say, I was
sorry for it, and promise God to do better next time, and there
get help again; for then I thought I pleased God as well as any
man in <i>England</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l31" id="l31">31</a>.&nbsp; Thus I continued about a year; all which time our
neighbours did take me to be a very godly man, a new and
religious man, and did marvel much to see such a great and famous
alteration in my life and manners; and indeed so it was, though
yet I knew not Christ, nor grace, nor faith, nor hope; for, as I
have well seen since, had I then died, my state had been most
fearful.</p>
<p><a href="#l32" id="l32">32</a>.&nbsp; But, I say, my neighbours were amazed at this my
great conversion, from prodigious profaneness, to something like
a moral life; and truly, so they well might; for this my
conversion was as great, as for Tom of Bethlehem to become a
sober man.&nbsp; Now therefore they began to praise, to commend,
and to speak well of me, both to my face, and behind my
back.&nbsp; Now I was, as they said, become godly; now I was
become a right honest man.&nbsp; But oh! when I understood these
were their words and opinions of me, it pleased me mighty
well.&nbsp; For, though as yet I was nothing but a poor painted
hypocrite, yet, I loved to be talked of as one that was truly
godly.&nbsp; I was proud of my godliness, and indeed, I did all I
did, either to be seen of, or to be well spoken of, by men: and
thus I continued for about a twelvemonth, or more.</p>
<p><a href="#l33" id="l33">33</a>.&nbsp; Now you must know, that, before this, I had taken
much delight in ringing, but my <i>conscience</i> beginning to be
tender, I thought such <i>practice</i> was but vain, and
therefore forced myself to leave it; yet my mind hankered;
wherefore I would go to the steeple-house, and look on, though I
durst not ring: but I thought this did not become religion
neither; yet I forced myself, and would look on still, but
quickly after, I began to think, <i>how if one of the bells
should fall</i>?&nbsp; Then I chose to stand under a main beam,
that lay overthwart the steeple, from side to side, thinking here
I might stand sure; but then I should think again, should the
bell fall with a swing, it might first hit the wall, and then,
rebounding upon me, might kill me for all this beam; this made me
stand in the steeple-door; and now, thought I, I am safe enough;
for if the bell should now fall, I can slip out behind these
thick walls, and so be preserved notwithstanding.</p>
<p><a href="#l34" id="l34">34</a>.&nbsp; So after this I would yet go to see them ring, but
would not go any farther than the steeple-door; but then it came
into my head, how if the steeple itself should fall?&nbsp; And
this thought (it may for aught I know) when I stood and looked
on, did continually so shake my mind, that I durst not stand at
the steeple-door any longer, but was forced to flee, for fear the
steeple should fall upon my head.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="#l35" id="l35">35</a>.&nbsp; Another thing was, my dancing; I was a full year
before I could quite leave that; but all this while, when I
thought I kept this or that commandment, or did, by word or deed,
anything that I thought was good, I had great peace in my
conscience, and should think with myself, God cannot choose but
be now pleased with me; yea, to relate it in mine own way, I
thought no man in <i>England</i> could please God better than
I.</p>
<p><a href="#l36" id="l36">36</a>.&nbsp; But poor wretch as I was!&nbsp; I was all this while
ignorant of Jesus Christ; and going about to establish my own
righteousness; and had perished therein, had not God in mercy
showed me more of my state by nature.</p>
<p><a href="#l37" id="l37">37</a>.&nbsp; But upon a day, the good providence of God called me
to <i>Bedford</i>, to work on my calling; and in one of the
streets of that town, I came where there were three or four poor
women sitting at a door, in the sun, talking about the things of
God; and being now willing to hear them discourse, I drew near to
hear what they said, for I was now a brisk talker also myself, in
the matters of religion; but I may say, <i>I heard but understood
not</i>; for they were far above, out of my reach.&nbsp; Their
talk was about a new birth, the work of God on their hearts, also
how they were convinced of their miserable state by nature; they
talked how God had visited their souls with His love in the Lord
Jesus, and with what words and promises they had been refreshed,
comforted, and supported, against the temptations of the devil:
moreover, they reasoned of the suggestions and temptations of
Satan in particular; and told to each other, by which they had
been afflicted and how they were borne up under his
assaults.&nbsp; They also discoursed of their own wretchedness of
heart, and of their unbelief; and did contemn, slight and abhor
their own righteousness, as filthy, and insufficient to do them
any good.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="#l38" id="l38">38</a>.&nbsp; And, methought, they spake as if joy did make them
speak; they spake with such pleasantness of scripture language,
and with such appearance of grace in all they said, that they
were to me, as if they had found a new world; as if they were
<i>people that dwelt alone</i>, <i>and were not to be reckoned
among their neighbours</i>.&nbsp; Numb. xxiii. 9.</p>
<p><a href="#l39" id="l39">39</a>.&nbsp; At this I felt my own heart began to shake, and
mistrust my condition to be naught; for I saw that in all my
thoughts about religion and salvation, the new-birth did never
enter into my mind; neither knew I the comfort of the word and
promise, nor the deceitfulness and treachery of my own wicked
heart.&nbsp; As for secret thoughts, I took no notice of them;
neither did I understand what Satan&rsquo;s temptations were, nor
how they were to be withstood, and resisted, etc.</p>
<p><a href="#l40" id="l40">40</a>.&nbsp; Thus, therefore, when I had heard and considered
what they said, I left them, and went about my employment again,
but their talk and discourse went with me; also my heart would
tarry with them, for I was greatly affected with their words,
both because by them I was convinced that I wanted the true
tokens of a truly godly man, and also because by them I was
convinced of the happy and blessed condition of him that was such
a one.</p>
<p><a href="#l41" id="l41">41</a>.&nbsp; Therefore I should often make it my business to be
going again and again into the company of these poor people; for
I could not stay away; and the more I went amongst them, the more
I did question my condition; and as I still do remember,
presently I found two things within me, at which I did sometimes
marvel (especially considering what a blind, ignorant, sordid and
ungodly wretch but just before I was).&nbsp; The one was a very
great softness and tenderness of heart, which caused me to fall
under the conviction of what by scripture they asserted, and the
other was a great bending in my mind, to a continual meditating
on it, and on all other good things, which at any time I heard or
read of.</p>
<p><a href="#l42" id="l42">42</a>.&nbsp; By these things my mind was now so turned, that it
lay like an horse-leech at the vein, still crying out,
<i>Give</i>, <i>Give</i>, Prov. xxx. 15; yea, it was so fixed on
eternity, and on the things about the kingdom of heaven (that is,
so far as I knew, though as yet, God knows, I knew but little),
that neither pleasures, nor profits, nor persuasions, nor
threats, could loose it, or make it let go its hold; and though I
may speak it with shame, yet it is in very deed, a certain truth,
it would then have been as difficult for me to have taken my mind
from heaven to earth, as I have found it often since, to get
again from earth to heaven.</p>
<p><a href="#l43" id="l43">43</a>.&nbsp; One thing I may not omit: There was a young man in
our town, to whom my heart before was knit, more than to any
other, but he being a most wicked creature for cursing, and
swearing, and whoreing, I now shook him off, and forsook his
company; but about a quarter of a year after I had left him, I
met him in a certain lane, and asked him how he did: he, after
his old swearing and mad way, answered, he was well.&nbsp; But,
Harry, said I, <i>why do you curse and swear thus</i>?&nbsp;
<i>What will become of you</i>, <i>if you die in this
condition</i>?&nbsp; He answered me in a great chafe, <i>What
would the devil do for company</i>, <i>if it were not for such as
I am</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l44" id="l44">44</a>.&nbsp; About this time I met with some Ranters&rsquo;
books, that were put forth by some of our countrymen, which books
were also highly in esteem by several old professors; some of
these I read, but was not able to make any judgment about them;
wherefore as I read in them, and thought upon them (seeing myself
unable to judge), I would betake myself to hearty prayer in this
manner.&nbsp; <i>O Lord</i>, <i>I am a fool</i>, <i>and not able
to know the truth from error</i>: <i>Lord</i>, <i>leave me not to
my own blindness</i>, <i>either to approve of or condemn this
doctrine</i>; <i>if it be of God</i>, <i>let me not despise
it</i>; <i>if it be of the devil</i>, <i>let me not embrace
it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Lord</i>, <i>I lay my soul in this matter only
at Thy foot</i>, <i>let me not be deceived</i>, <i>I humbly
beseech Thee</i>.&nbsp; I had one religious intimate companion
all this while, and that was the poor man I spoke of before; but
about this time, he also turned a most devilish Ranter, and gave
himself up to all manner of filthiness, especially uncleanness:
he would also deny that there was a God, angel, or spirit; and
would laugh at all exhortations to sobriety; when I laboured to
rebuke his wickedness he would laugh the more, and pretend that
he had gone through all religions, and could never light on the
right till now.&nbsp; He told me also, that in a little time I
should see all professors turn to the ways of the Ranters.&nbsp;
Wherefore, abominating those cursed principles, I left his
company forthwith, and became to him as great a stranger, as I
had been before a familiar.</p>
<p><a href="#l45" id="l45">45</a>.&nbsp; Neither was this man only a temptation to me, but my
calling lying in the country, I happened to light into several
people&rsquo;s company, who though strict in religion formerly,
yet were also swept away by these Ranters.&nbsp; These would also
talk with me of their ways, and condemn me as legal and dark;
pretending that they only had attained to perfection, that could
do what they would and not sin.&nbsp; Oh! these temptations were
suitable to my flesh, I being but a young man and my nature in
its prime; but God, who had, as I hoped, designed me for better
things, kept me in the fear of His name, and did not suffer me to
accept such cursed principles.&nbsp; And blessed be God, Who put
it into my heart to cry to Him to be kept and directed, still
distrusting my own wisdom; for I have since seen even the effects
of that prayer, in His preserving me, not only from Ranting
errors, but from those also that have sprung up since.&nbsp; The
Bible was precious to me in those days.</p>
<p><a href="#l46" id="l46">46</a>.&nbsp; And now methought, I began to look into the Bible
with new eyes, and read as I never did before, and especially the
epistles of the apostle St Paul were sweet and pleasant to me;
and indeed I was then never out of the Bible, either by reading
or meditation; still crying out to God, that I might know the
truth, and way to heaven and glory.</p>
<p><a href="#l47" id="l47">47</a>.&nbsp; And as I went on and read, I lighted upon that
passage, <i>To one is given</i>, <i>by the Spirit</i>, <i>the
word of wisdom</i>; <i>to another the word knowledge by the same
Spirit</i>; <i>and to another faith</i>, etc.&nbsp; 1 Cor.
xii.&nbsp; And though, as I have since seen, that by this
scripture the Holy Ghost intends, in special, things
extraordinary, yet on me it did then fasten with conviction, that
I did want things ordinary, even that understanding and wisdom
that other Christians had.&nbsp; On this word I mused, and could
not tell what to do, especially this word &lsquo;Faith&rsquo; put
me to it, for I could not help it, but sometimes must question,
whether I had any faith, or no; but I was loath to conclude, I
had no faith; for if I do so, thought I, then I shall count
myself a very cast-away indeed.</p>
<p><a href="#l48" id="l48">48</a>.&nbsp; No, said I, with myself, though I am convinced that
I am an ignorant sot, and that I want those blessed gifts of
knowledge and understanding that other people have; yet at a
venture I will conclude, I am not altogether faithless, though I
know not what faith is; for it was shewn me, and that too (as I
have seen since) by Satan, that those who conclude themselves in
a faithless state, have neither rest nor quiet in their souls;
and I was loath to fall quite into despair.</p>
<p><a href="#l49" id="l49">49</a>.&nbsp; Wherefore by this suggestion I was, for a while,
made afraid to see my want of faith; but God would not suffer me
thus to undo and destroy my soul, but did continually, against
this my sad and blind conclusion, create still within me such
suppositions, insomuch that I could not rest content, until I did
now come to some certain knowledge, whether I had faith or no,
this always running in my mind, <i>But how if you want faith
indeed</i>?&nbsp; <i>But how can you tell you have
faith</i>?&nbsp; And besides, I saw for certain, if I had not, I
was sure to perish for ever.</p>
<p><a href="#l50" id="l50">50</a>.&nbsp; So that though I endeavoured at the first to look
over the business of Faith, yet in a little time, I better
considering the matter, was willing to put myself upon the trial
whether I had faith or no.&nbsp; But alas, poor wretch! so
ignorant and brutish was I, that I knew not to this day no more
how to do it, than I know how to begin and accomplish that rare
and curious piece of art, which I never yet saw or
considered.</p>
<p><a href="#l51" id="l51">51</a>.&nbsp; Wherefore while I was thus considering, and being
put to my plunge about it (for you must know, that as yet I had
in this matter broken my mind to no man, only did hear and
consider), the tempter came in with this delusion, <i>That there
was no way for me to know I had faith</i>, <i>but by trying to
work some miracle</i>; urging those scriptures that seem to look
that way, for the enforcing and strengthening his
temptation.&nbsp; Nay, one day, as I was between <i>Elstow</i>
and <i>Bedford</i>, the temptation was hot upon me, to try if I
had faith, by doing some miracle; which miracle at this time was
this, I must say to the <i>puddles</i> that were in the
horsepads, <i>Be dry</i>; and to the <i>dry places</i>, <i>Be you
puddles</i>: and truly one time I was going to say so indeed; but
just as I was about to speak, this thought came into my mind;
<i>But go under yonder hedge and pray first</i>, <i>that God
would make you able</i>.&nbsp; But when I had concluded to pray,
this came hot upon me; That if I prayed, and came again and tried
to do it, and yet did nothing notwithstanding, then to be sure I
had no faith, but was a cast-away, and lost; nay, thought I, if
it be so, I will not try yet, but will stay a little longer.</p>
<p><a href="#l52" id="l52">52</a>.&nbsp; So I continued at a great loss; for I thought, if
they only had faith, which could do so wonderful things, then I
concluded, that for the present I neither had it, nor yet for the
time to come, were ever like to have it.&nbsp; Thus I was tossed
betwixt the devil and my own ignorance, and so perplexed,
especially at some times, that I could not tell what to do.</p>
<p><a href="#l53" id="l53">53</a>.&nbsp; About this time, the state and happiness of these
poor people at Bedford was thus, <i>in a kind of a vision</i>,
presented to me, I saw as if they were on the sunny side of some
high mountain, there refreshing themselves with the pleasant
beams of the sun, while I was shivering and shrinking in the
cold, afflicted with frost, snow and dark clouds: methought also,
betwixt me and them, I saw a wall that did compass about this
mountain, now through this wall my soul did greatly desire to
pass; concluding, that if I could, I would even go into the very
midst of them, and there also comfort myself with the heat of
their sun.</p>
<p><a href="#l54" id="l54">54</a>.&nbsp; About this wall I bethought myself, to go again and
again, still prying as I went, to see if I could find some way or
passage, by which I might enter therein: but none could I find
for some time: at the last, I saw, as it were, a narrow gap, like
a little door-way in the wall, through which I attempted to pass:
Now the passage being very strait and narrow, I made many offers
to get in, but all in vain, even until I was well-nigh quite beat
out, by striving to get in; at last, with great striving,
methought I at first did get in my head, and after that, by a
sideling striving, my shoulders, and my whole body; then I was
exceeding glad, went and sat down in the midst of them, and so
was comforted with the light and heat of their sun.</p>
<p><a href="#l55" id="l55">55</a>.&nbsp; Now this mountain, and wall, etc., was thus made out
to me: The mountain signified the church of the living God: the
sun that shone thereon, the comfortable shining of His merciful
face on them that were therein; the wall I thought was the word,
that did make separation between the Christians and the world;
and the gap which was in the wall, I thought, was Jesus Christ,
Who is the way to God the Father.&nbsp; John xiv. 6; Matt. vii.
14.&nbsp; But forasmuch as the passage was wonderful narrow, even
so narrow that I could not, but with great difficulty, enter in
thereat, it showed me, that none could enter into life, but those
that were in downright earnest, and unless also they left that
wicked world behind them; for here was only room for body and
soul, but not for body and soul and sin.</p>
<p><a href="#l56" id="l56">56</a>.&nbsp; This resemblance abode upon my spirit many days; all
which time I saw myself in a forlorn and sad condition, but yet
was provoked to a vehement hunger and desire to be one of that
number that did sit in the sunshine: Now also I should pray
wherever I was: whether at home or abroad; in house or field; and
would also often, with lifting up of heart, sing that of the
fifty-first Psalm, <i>O Lord</i>, <i>consider my distress</i>;
for as yet I knew not where I was.</p>
<p><a href="#l57" id="l57">57</a>.&nbsp; Neither as yet could I attain to any comfortable
persuasion that I had faith in Christ; but instead of having
satisfaction here, I began to find my soul to be assaulted with
fresh doubts about my future happiness; especially with such as
these, <i>whether I was elected</i>?&nbsp; <i>But how</i>, <i>if
the day of grace should now be past and gone</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l58" id="l58">58</a>.&nbsp; By these two temptations I was very much afflicted
and disquieted; sometimes by one, and sometimes by the other of
them.&nbsp; And first, to speak of that about my questioning my
election, I found at this time, that though I was in a flame to
find the way to heaven and glory, and though nothing could beat
me off from this, yet this question did so offend and discourage
me, that I was, especially sometimes, as if the very strength of
my body also had been taken away by the force and power
thereof.&nbsp; This scripture did also seem to me to trample upon
all my desires; <i>It is not of him that willeth</i>, <i>nor of
him that runneth</i>; <i>but of God that showeth mercy</i>.&nbsp;
Rom. ix. 16.</p>
<p><a href="#l59" id="l59">59</a>.&nbsp; With this scripture I could not tell what to do: for
I evidently saw, unless that the great God, of His infinite grace
and bounty, had voluntarily chosen me to be a vessel of mercy,
though I should desire, and long, and labour until my heart did
break, no good could come of it.&nbsp; Therefore this would stick
with me, <i>How can you tell that you are elected</i>?&nbsp;
<i>And what if you should not</i>?&nbsp; <i>How then</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l60" id="l60">60</a>.&nbsp; O Lord, thought I, what if I should not
indeed?&nbsp; It may be you are not, said the Tempter; it may be
so indeed, thought I.&nbsp; Why then, said Satan, you had as good
leave off, and strive no farther; for if indeed, you should not
be elected and chosen of God, there is no talk of your being
saved; <i>For it is not of him that willeth</i>, <i>nor of him
that runneth</i>; <i>but of God that showeth mercy</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l61" id="l61">61</a>.&nbsp; By these things I was driven to my wits&rsquo; end,
not knowing what to say, or how to answer these temptations:
(indeed, I little thought that Satan had thus assaulted me, but
that rather it was my own prudence thus to start the question):
for that the elect only attained eternal life; that, I without
scruple did heartily close withal; but that myself was one of
them, there lay the question.</p>
<p><a href="#l62" id="l62">62</a>.&nbsp; Thus therefore, for several days, I was greatly
assaulted and perplexed, and was often, when I have been walking,
ready to sink where I went, with faintness in my mind; but one
day, after I had been so many weeks oppressed and cast down
therewith as I was now quite giving up the ghost of all my hopes
of ever attaining life, that sentence fell with weight upon my
spirit, <i>Look at the generations of old</i>, <i>and see</i>;
<i>did ever any trust in God</i>, <i>and were confounded</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l63" id="l63">63</a>.&nbsp; At which I was greatly lightened, and encouraged in
my soul; for thus, at that very instant, it was expounded to me:
<i>Begin at the beginning of Genesis</i>, <i>and read to the end
of the Revelations</i>, <i>and see if you can find</i>, <i>that
there were ever any that trusted in the Lord</i>, <i>and were
confounded</i>.&nbsp; So coming home, I presently went to my
Bible, to see if I could find that saying, not doubting but to
find it presently; for it was so fresh, and with such strength
and comfort on my spirit, that it was as if it talked with
me.</p>
<p><a href="#l64" id="l64">64</a>.&nbsp; Well, I looked, but I found it not; only it abode
upon me: Then did I ask first this good man, and then another, if
they knew where it was, but they knew no such place.&nbsp; At
this I wondered, that such a sentence should so suddenly, and
with such comfort and strength, seize, and abide upon my heart;
and yet that none could find it (for I doubted not but that it
was in holy scripture).</p>
<p><a href="#l65" id="l65">65</a>.&nbsp; Thus I continued above a year, and could not find
the place; but at last, casting my eye upon the <i>Apocrypha</i>
books, I found it in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>, Eccles. ii. 10.&nbsp;
This, at the first, did somewhat daunt me; but because by this
time I had got more experience of the love and kindness of God,
it troubled me the less, especially when I considered that though
it was not in those texts that we call holy and canonical; yet
forasmuch as this sentence was the sum and substance of many of
the promises, it was my duty to take the comfort of it; and I
bless God for that word, for it was of God to me: that word doth
still at times shine before my face.</p>
<p><a href="#l66" id="l66">66</a>.&nbsp; After this, that other doubt did come with strength
upon me, <i>But how if the day of grace should be past and
gone</i>?&nbsp; How if you have overstood the time of
mercy?&nbsp; Now I remember that one day, as I was walking in the
country, I was much in the thoughts of this, <i>But how if the
day of grace is past</i>?&nbsp; And to aggravate my trouble, the
Tempter presented to my mind those good people of <i>Bedford</i>,
and suggested thus unto me, that these being converted already,
they were all that God would save in those parts; and that I came
too late, for these had got the blessing before I came.</p>
<p><a href="#l67" id="l67">67</a>.&nbsp; Now I was in great distress, thinking in very deed
that this might well be so; wherefore I went up and down,
bemoaning my sad condition; counting myself far worse than a
thousand fools for standing off thus long, and spending so many
years in sin as I had done; still crying out, Oh! that I had
turned sooner!&nbsp; Oh! that I had turned seven years ago!&nbsp;
It made me also angry with myself, to think that I should have no
more wit, but to trifle away my time, till my soul and heaven
were lost.</p>
<p><a href="#l68" id="l68">68</a>.&nbsp; But when I had been long vexed with this fear, and
was scarce able to take one step more, just about the same place
where I received my other encouragement, these words broke in
upon my mind, <i>Compel them to come in</i>, <i>that my house may
be filled</i>; <i>and yet there is room</i>.&nbsp; Luke xiv. 22,
23.&nbsp; These words, but especially those, <i>And yet there is
room</i>, were sweet words to me; for truly I thought that by
them I saw there was place enough in heaven for me; and moreover,
that when the Lord Jesus did speak these words, He then did think
of me: and that He knowing that the time would come, that I
should be afflicted with fear, that there was no place left for
me in His bosom, did before speak this word, and leave it upon
record, that I might find help thereby against this vile
temptation.&nbsp; This I then verily believed.</p>
<p><a href="#l69" id="l69">69</a>.&nbsp; In the light and encouragement of this word I went a
pretty while; and the comfort was the more, when I thought that
the Lord Jesus should think on me so long ago, and that He should
speak those words on purpose for my sake; for I did think verily,
that He did on purpose speak them to encourage me withal.</p>
<p><a href="#l70" id="l70">70</a>.&nbsp; But I was not without my temptations to go back
again; temptations I say, both from Satan, mine own heart, and
carnal acquaintance; but I thank God these were outweighed by
that sound sense of death, and of the day of judgment, which
abode, as it were, continually in my view: I would often also
think on <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>; of whom it is said, <i>He had
given him all the kingdoms of the earth</i>.&nbsp; Dan. v. 18,
19.&nbsp; Yet, thought I, if this great man had all his portion
in this world, one hour in hell-fire would make him forget
all.&nbsp; Which consideration was a great help to me.</p>
<p><a href="#l71" id="l71">71</a>.&nbsp; I was also made, about this time, to see something
concerning the beasts that <i>Moses</i> counted clean and
unclean: I thought those beasts were types of men; the
<i>clean</i>, types of them that were the people of God; but the
<i>unclean</i>, types of such as were the children of the wicked
one.&nbsp; Now I read, that the clean beasts <i>chewed the
cud</i>; that is, thought I, they show us, we must feed upon the
word of God: they also <i>parted the hoof</i>.&nbsp; I thought
that signified, we must part, if we would be saved, with the ways
of ungodly men.&nbsp; And also, in further reading about them, I
found, that though we did chew the cud, as the <i>hare</i>; yet
if we walked with claws, like a dog; or if we did part the hoof,
like the <i>swine</i>, yet if we did not chew the cud, as the
sheep, we were still, for all that, but unclean: for I thought
the <i>hare</i> to be a type of those that talk of the word, yet
walk in the ways of sin; and that the <i>swine</i> was like him
that parted with his outward pollutions, but still wanteth the
word of faith, without which there could be no way of salvation,
let a man be never so devout.&nbsp; Deut. xiv.&nbsp; After this,
I found by reading the word, that those that must be glorified
with Christ in another world <i>must be called by Him here</i>;
called to the partaking of a share in His word and righteousness,
and to the comforts and first-fruits of His Spirit; and to a
peculiar interest in all those heavenly things, which do indeed
prepare the soul for that rest, and house of glory, which is in
heaven above.</p>
<p><a href="#l72" id="l72">72</a>.&nbsp; Here again I was at a very I great stand, not
knowing what to do, fearing I was not called; for, thought I, if
I be not called, what then can do me good?&nbsp; None but those
who are effectually called inherit the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;
But oh! how I now loved those words that spake of a
<i>Christian&rsquo;s calling</i>! as when the Lord said to one,
<i>Follow Me</i>; and to another, <i>Come after Me</i>: and oh,
thought I, that He would say so to me too: how gladly would I run
after Him!</p>
<p><a href="#l73" id="l73">73</a>.&nbsp; I cannot now express with what longings and
breathings in my soul, I cried to Christ to call me.&nbsp; Thus I
continued for a time, all on a flame to be converted to Jesus
Christ; and did also see at that day, such glory in a converted
state, that I could not be contented without a share
therein.&nbsp; Gold! could it have been gotten for gold, what
would I have given for it?&nbsp; Had I had a whole world, it had
all gone ten thousand times over for this, that my soul might
have been in a converted state.</p>
<p><a href="#l74" id="l74">74</a>.&nbsp; How lovely now was every one in my eyes, that I
thought to be converted men and women.&nbsp; They shone, they
walked like a people that carried the broad seal of heaven about
them.&nbsp; Oh! I saw the lot was fallen to them in pleasant
places, and they had a goodly heritage.&nbsp; Psalm xvi.&nbsp;
But that which made me sick, was that of Christ, in St Mark,
<i>He goeth up into a mountain</i>, <i>and calleth unto Him whom
He would</i>, <i>and they came unto Him</i>.&nbsp; Mark iii.
13.</p>
<p><a href="#l75" id="l75">75</a>.&nbsp; This scripture made me faint and fear, yet it
kindled fire in my soul.&nbsp; That which made me fear, was this;
lest Christ should have no liking to me, for He called <i>whom He
would</i>.&nbsp; But oh! the glory that I saw in that condition,
did still so engage my heart, that I could seldom read of any
that Christ did call, but I presently wished, <i>Would I had been
in their clothes</i>, <i>would I had been born Peter</i>;
<i>would I had been born John</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>would I had been
by and had heard Him when He called them</i>, <i>how would I have
cried</i>, <i>O Lord</i>, <i>call me also</i>!&nbsp; <i>But</i>,
<i>oh</i>!&nbsp; <i>I feared He would not call me</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l76" id="l76">76</a>.&nbsp; And truly, the Lord let me go thus many months
together, and shewed me nothing; either that I was already, or
should be called hereafter: but at last after much time spent,
and many groans to God, that I might be made partaker of the holy
and heavenly calling; that word came in upon me: <i>I will
cleanse their blood</i>, <i>that I have not cleansed</i>, <i>for
the Lord dwelleth in Zion</i>.&nbsp; Joel iii. 21.&nbsp; These
words I thought were sent to encourage me to wait still upon God;
and signified unto me, that if I were not already, yet time might
come, I might be in truth converted unto Christ.</p>
<p><a href="#l77" id="l77">77</a>.&nbsp; About this time I began to break my mind to those
poor people in <i>Bedford</i>, and to tell them my condition;
which when they had heard, they told Mr Gifford of me, who
himself also took occasion to talk with me, and was willing to be
well persuaded of me, though I think from little grounds: but he
invited me to his house, where I should hear him confer with
others, about the dealings of God with their souls; from all
which I still received more conviction, and from that time began
to see something of the vanity and inward wretchedness of my
wicked heart; for as yet I knew no great matter therein; but now
it began to be discovered unto me, and also to work at that rate
as it never did before.&nbsp; Now I evidently found, that lusts
and corruptions put forth themselves within me, in wicked
thoughts and desires, which I did not regard before; my desires
also for heaven and life began to fail; I found also, that
whereas before my soul was full of longing after God, now it
began to hanker after every foolish vanity; yea, my heart would
not be moved to mind that which was good; it began to be
careless, both of my soul and heaven; it would now continually
hang back, both to, and in every duty; and was as a clog on the
leg of a bird, to hinder me from flying.</p>
<p><a href="#l78" id="l78">78</a>.&nbsp; Nay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse: now I am
farther from conversion than ever I was before.&nbsp; Wherefore I
began to sink greatly in my soul, and began to entertain such
discouragement in my heart, as laid me as low as hell.&nbsp; If
now I should have burned at the stake, I could not believe that
Christ had love for me: alas!&nbsp; I could neither hear Him, nor
see Him, nor feel Him, nor favour any of His things; I was driven
as with a tempest, my heart would be unclean, and the
<i>Canaanites</i> would dwell in the land.</p>
<p><a href="#l79" id="l79">79</a>.&nbsp; Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people of
God; which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell
me of the promises; but they had as good have told me, that I
must reach the sun with my finger, as have bidden me receive or
rely upon the promises: and as soon I should have done it.&nbsp;
All my sense and feeling were against me; and I saw I had an
heart that would sin, and that lay under a law that would
condemn.</p>
<p><a href="#l80" id="l80">80</a>.&nbsp; These things have often made me think of the child
which the father brought to Christ, <i>who</i>, <i>while he was
yet coming to Him</i>, <i>was thrown down by the devil</i>,
<i>and also so rent and torn by him</i>, <i>that he lay down and
wallowed</i>, <i>foaming</i>.&nbsp; Luke ix. 42; Mark ix. 20.</p>
<p><a href="#l81" id="l81">81</a>.&nbsp; Further, in these days, I would find my heart to
shut itself up against the Lord, and against His holy word: I
have found my unbelief to set, as it were, the shoulder to the
door, to keep Him out; and that too even then, when I have with
many a bitter sigh, cried, Good Lord, break it open: <i>Lord</i>,
<i>break these gates of brass</i>, <i>and cut these bars of iron
asunder</i>.&nbsp; Psalm cvii. 16.&nbsp; Yet that word would
sometimes create in my heart a peaceable pause, <i>I girded
thee</i>, <i>though thou hast not known Me</i>.&nbsp; Isaiah xlv.
5.</p>
<p><a href="#l82" id="l82">82</a>.&nbsp; But all this while, as to the act of sinning, I was
never more tender than now: my hinder parts were inward: I durst
not take a pin or stick, though but so big as a straw; for my
conscience now was sore, and would smart at every touch: I could
not now tell how to speak my words, for fear I should misplace
them.&nbsp; Oh, how gingerly did I then go, in all I did or
said!&nbsp; I found myself as on a miry bog, that shook if I did
but stir, and was, as there, left both of God and Christ, and the
Spirit, and all good things.</p>
<p><a href="#l83" id="l83">83</a>.&nbsp; But I observed, though I was such a great sinner
before conversion, yet God never much charged the guilt of the
sins of my ignorance upon me; only He showed me, I was lost if I
had not Christ, because I had been a sinner: I saw that I wanted
a perfect righteousness to present me without fault before God,
and this righteousness was no where to be found, but in the
Person of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><a href="#l84" id="l84">84</a>.&nbsp; But my original and inward pollution; That, that was
my plague and affliction, that I saw at a dreadful rate, always
putting forth itself within me; that I had the guilt of, to
amazement; by reason of that, I was more loathsome in mine own
eyes than was a toad, and I thought I was so in God&rsquo;s eyes
too: Sin and corruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of
my heart, as water would bubble out of a fountain: I thought now,
that every one had a better heart than I had; I could have
changed heart with any body; I thought none but the devil himself
could equalise me for inward wickedness and pollution of
mind.&nbsp; I fell therefore at the sight of my own vileness
deeply into despair; for I concluded, that this condition that I
was in, could not stand with a state of grace.&nbsp; Sure,
thought I, I am forsaken of God; sure, I am given up to the
devil, and to a reprobate mind: and thus I continued a long
while, even for some years together.</p>
<p><a href="#l85" id="l85">85</a>.&nbsp; While I was thus afflicted with the fears of my own
damnation, there were two things would make me wonder; the one
was, when I saw old people hunting after the things of this life,
as if they should live here always: the other was, when I found
professors much distressed and cast down, when they met with
outward losses; as of husband, wife, child, etc.&nbsp; Lord,
thought I, what a-do is here about such little things as
these!&nbsp; What seeking after carnal things, by some, and what
grief in others for the loss of them! if they so much labour
after, and shed so many tears for the things of this present
life, how am I to be bemoaned, pitied, and prayed for!&nbsp; My
soul is dying, my soul is damning.&nbsp; Were my soul but in a
good condition, and were I but sure of it, ah! how rich should I
esteem myself, though blessed but with bread and water!&nbsp; I
should count those but small afflictions, and should bear them as
little burthens.&nbsp; <i>A wounded spirit who can bear</i>!</p>
<p><a href="#l86" id="l86">86</a>. And though I was much troubled, and tossed, and afflicted,
with the sight and sense and terror of my own wickedness, yet I
was afraid to let this sight and sense go quite off my mind: that
unless guilt of conscience was taken off the right way, that is,
by the blood of Christ a man grew rather worse for the loss of
his trouble of mind, than better.&nbsp; Wherefore, if my guilt
lay hard upon me, then I should cry that the blood of Christ
might take it off: and if it was going off without it (for the
sense of sin would be sometimes as if it would die, and go quite
away), then I would also strive to fetch it upon my heart again,
by bringing the punishment of sin in hell fire upon my spirit;
and should cry, <i>Lord</i>, <i>let it not go off my heart</i>,
<i>but the right way</i>, <i>by the blood of Christ</i>, <i>and
the application of Thy mercy</i>, <i>through Him</i>, <i>to my
soul</i>, for that scripture lay much upon me, <i>without
shedding of blood is no remission</i>.&nbsp; Heb. ix. 22.&nbsp;
And that which made me the more afraid of this, was, because I
had seen some, who though when they were under wounds of
conscience, would cry and pray; yet seeking rather present ease
from their trouble, than pardon for their sin, cared not how they
lost their guilt, so they got it out of their mind: now, having
got it off the wrong way, it was not sanctified unto them; but
they grew harder and blinder, and more wicked after their
trouble.&nbsp; This made me afraid, and made me cry to God the
more, that it might not be so with me.</p>
<p><a href="#l87" id="l87">87</a>.&nbsp; And now I was sorry that God had made me man, for I
feared I was a reprobate; I counted man as unconverted, the most
doleful of all the creatures.&nbsp; Thus being afflicted and
tossed about my sad condition, I counted myself alone, and above
the most of men unblessed.</p>
<p><a href="#l88" id="l88">88</a>.&nbsp; Yea, I thought it impossible that ever I should
attain to so much goodness of heart, as to thank God that He had
made me a man.&nbsp; Man indeed is the most noble by creation, of
all creatures in the visible world; but by sin he has made
himself the most ignoble.&nbsp; The beasts, birds, fishes,
etc.&nbsp; I blessed their condition; for they had not a sinful
nature; they were not obnoxious to the wrath of God; they were
not to go to hell-fire after death; I could therefore have
rejoiced, had my condition been as any of theirs.</p>
<p><a href="#l89" id="l89">89</a>.&nbsp; In this condition I went a great while, but when
comforting time was come, I heard one preach a sermon on these
words in the song, Song iv. 1, <i>Behold</i>, <i>thou art
fair</i>, <i>my love</i>, <i>behold</i>, <i>thou art
fair</i>.&nbsp; But at that time he made these two words, <i>my
love</i>, his chief and subject matter: from which, after he had
a little opened the text, he observed these several conclusions:
1. <i>That the church</i>, <i>and so every saved soul</i>, <i>is
Christ&rsquo;s love</i>, <i>when loveless</i>.&nbsp; 2.
<i>Christ&rsquo;s love without a cause</i>.&nbsp; 3.
<i>Christ&rsquo;s love</i>, <i>when hated of the world</i>.&nbsp;
4. <i>Christ&rsquo;s love</i>, <i>when under temptation and under
destruction</i>.&nbsp; 5. <i>Christ&rsquo;s love</i>, <i>from
first to last</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l90" id="l90">90</a>.&nbsp; But I got nothing by what he said at present; only
when he came to the application of the fourth particular, this
was the word he said; <i>If it be so</i>, <i>that the saved soul
is Christ&rsquo;s love</i>, <i>when under temptation and
desertion</i>; <i>then poor tempted soul</i>, <i>when thou art
assaulted</i>, <i>and afflicted with temptations</i>, <i>and the
hidings of God&rsquo;s face</i>, <i>yet think on these two
words</i>, &lsquo;My love,&rsquo; <i>still</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l91" id="l91">91</a>.&nbsp; So as I was going home, these words came again into
my thoughts; and I well remember, as they came in, I said thus in
my heart, <i>What shall I get by thinking on these two
words</i>?&nbsp; This thought had no sooner passed through my
heart, but these words began thus to kindle in my spirit, <i>Thou
art My Love</i>, <i>thou art My Dove</i>, twenty times together;
and still as they ran in my mind, they waxed stronger and warmer,
and began to make me look up; but being as yet, between hope and
fear, I still replied in my heart, <i>But is it true</i>, <i>but
is it true</i>?&nbsp; At which that sentence fell upon me, <i>He
wist not that it was true</i>, <i>which was done by the
Angel</i>.&nbsp; Acts xii. 9.</p>
<p><a href="#l92" id="l92">92</a>.&nbsp; Then I began to give place to the word which with
power, did over and over make this joyful sound within my soul,
&lsquo;<i>Thou art my Love</i>, <i>thou art My Love</i>, <i>and
nothing shall separate thee from My Love</i>.&nbsp; And with that
my heart was filled full of comfort and hope, and now I could
believe that my sins should be forgiven me; yea, I was now so
taken with the love and mercy of God, that I remember I could not
tell how to contain till I got home: I thought I could have
spoken of His love, and have told of His mercy to me, even to the
very crows, that sat upon the ploughed lands before me, had they
been capable to have understood me: wherefore I said in my soul,
with much gladness, <i>Well</i>, <i>I would I had a pen and ink
here</i>, <i>I would write this down before I go any farther</i>;
<i>for surely I will not forget this forty years hence</i>.&nbsp;
But, alas! within less than forty days I began to question all
again; which made me begin to question all still.</p>
<p><a href="#l93" id="l93">93</a>.&nbsp; Yet still at times I was helped to believe, that it
was a true manifestation of grace unto my soul, though I had lost
much of the life and favour of it.&nbsp; Now about a week or a
fortnight after this I was much followed by this scripture,
<i>Simon</i>, <i>Simon</i>; <i>behold</i>, <i>Satan hath desired
to have you</i>, Luke xxii. 31, and sometimes it would sound so
loud within me, yea, and as it was, call so strongly after me,
that once, above all the rest, I turned my head over my shoulder,
thinking verily that some man had behind me, called me; being at
a great distance, methought he called so loud: it came, as I have
thought since, to have stirred me up to prayer, and to
watchfulness: it came to acquaint me, that a cloud and a storm
was coming down upon me: but I understood it not.</p>
<p><a href="#l94" id="l94">94</a>.&nbsp; Also, as I remember, that time that it called to me
so loud, was the last time that it sounded in mine ears; but me
thinks I hear still with what a loud voice these words,
<i>Simon</i>, <i>Simon</i>, sounded in mine ears.&nbsp; I thought
verily, as I have told you, that somebody had called after me,
that was half a mile behind me: and although that was not my
name, yet it made me suddenly look behind me, believing that he
that called so loud, meant me.</p>
<p><a href="#l95" id="l95">95</a>.&nbsp; But so foolish was I, and ignorant, that I knew not
the reason of this sound; (which as I did both see and feel soon
after, was sent from heaven as an alarm, to awaken me to provide
for what was coming,) only I should muse and wonder in my mind,
to think what should be the reason of this scripture, and that at
this rate, so often and so loud, should still be sounding and
rattling in mine ears: but, as I said before, I soon after
perceived the end of God therein.</p>
<p><a href="#l96" id="l96">96</a>.&nbsp; For, about the space of a month after, a very great
storm came down upon me, which handled me twenty times worse than
all I had met with before; it came stealing upon me, now by one
piece, then by another: First, all my comfort was taken from me;
then darkness seized upon me; after which, whole floods of
blasphemies, both against God, Christ, and the scriptures, were
poured upon my spirit, to my great confusion and
astonishment.&nbsp; These blasphemous thoughts were such as
stirred up questions in me against the very being of God, and of
His only beloved Son: As, whether there were in truth, a God or
Christ?&nbsp; And whether the holy scriptures were not rather a
fable, and cunning story, than the holy and pure word of God?</p>
<p><a href="#l97" id="l97">97</a>.&nbsp; The tempter would also much assault me with this,
<i>How can you tell but that the</i> Turks <i>had as good
scriptures to prove their</i> Mahomet <i>the Saviour</i>, <i>as
we have to prove our Jesus is</i>?&nbsp; <i>And</i>, <i>could I
think</i>, <i>that so many ten thousands</i>, <i>in so many
countries and kingdoms</i>, <i>should be without the knowledge of
the right way to heaven</i>, (<i>if there were indeed a
heaven</i>); <i>and that we only</i>, <i>who live in a corner of
the earth</i>, <i>should alone be blessed therewith</i>?&nbsp;
<i>Every one doth think his own religion rightest</i>,
<i>both</i> Jews <i>and</i> Moors, <i>and</i> Pagans; <i>and how
if all our faith</i>, <i>and Christ</i>, <i>and scriptures</i>,
<i>should be but a think so too</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l98" id="l98">98</a>.&nbsp; Sometimes I have endeavoured to argue against these
suggestions, and to set some of the sentences of blessed
<i>Paul</i> against them; but alas! I quickly felt, when I thus
did, such arguings as these would return again upon me, <i>Though
we made so great a matter of Paul</i>, <i>and of his words</i>,
<i>yet how could I tell</i>, <i>but that in very deed</i>, <i>he
being a subtle and cunning man</i>, <i>might give himself up to
deceive with strong delusions</i>: <i>and also take the pains and
travel</i>, <i>to undo and destroy his fellows</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l99" id="l99">99</a>.&nbsp; These suggestions, (with many others which at this
time I may not, and dare not utter, neither by word or pen,) did
make such a seizure upon my spirit, and did so overweigh my
heart, both with their number, continuance, and fiery force, that
I felt as if there were nothing else but these from morning to
night within me; and as though indeed there could be room for
nothing else; and also concluded, that God had, in very wrath to
my soul, given me up to them, to be carried away with them, as
with a mighty whirlwind.</p>
<p><a href="#l100" id="l100">100</a>.&nbsp; Only by the distaste that they gave unto my spirit,
<i>I felt there was something in me that refused to embrace
them</i>.&nbsp; But this consideration I then only had, when God
gave me leave to swallow my spittle; otherwise the noise, and
strength, and force of these temptations would drown and
overflow, and as it were, bury all such thoughts, or the
remembrance of any such thing.&nbsp; While I was in this
temptation, I often found my mind suddenly put upon it to curse
and swear, or to speak some grievous thing against God, or Christ
His Son, and of the scriptures.</p>
<p><a href="#l101" id="l101">101</a>.&nbsp; Now I thought, <i>surely I am possessed of the
devil</i>: at other times, again, I thought I should be bereft of
my wits; for instead of lauding and magnifying God the Lord, with
others, if I have but heard Him spoken of, presently some most
horrible blasphemous thought or other would bolt out of my heart
against Him; so that whether I did think that God was, or again
did think there was no such thing, no love, nor peace, nor
gracious disposition could I feel within me.</p>
<p><a href="#l102" id="l102">102</a>.&nbsp; These things did sink me into very deep despair;
for I concluded that such things could not possibly be found
amongst them that loved God.&nbsp; I often, when these
temptations had been with force upon me, did compare myself to
the case of such a child, whom some gipsy hath by force took up
in her arms, and is carrying from friend and country.&nbsp; Kick
sometimes I did, and also shriek and cry; but yet I was bound in
the wings of the temptation, and the wind would carry me
away.&nbsp; I thought also of Saul, and of the evil spirit that
did possess him: and did greatly fear that my condition was the
same with that of his.&nbsp; 1 Sam. x.</p>
<p><a href="#l103" id="l103">103</a>.&nbsp; In these days, when I have heard others talk of
what was the sin against the Holy Ghost, then would the tempter
so provoke me to desire to sin that against sin, that I was as if
I could not, must not, neither should be quiet until I had
committed it; now no sin would serve but that.&nbsp; If it were
to be committed by speaking of such a word, then I have been as
if my mouth would have spoken that word, whether I would or no;
and in so strong a measure was this temptation upon me, that
often I have been ready to clap my hand under my chin, to hold my
mouth from opening; and to that end also, I have had thoughts at
other times, to leap with my head downward, into some
muckhill-hole or other, to keep my mouth from speaking.</p>
<p><a href="#l104" id="l104">104</a>.&nbsp; Now again I beheld the condition of the dog and
toad, and counted the estate of every thing that God had made,
far better than this dreadful state of mine, and such as my
companions were.&nbsp; Yea, gladly would I have been in the
condition of a dog or horse: for I knew they had no souls to
perish under the everlasting weight of hell, or sin, as mine was
like to do.&nbsp; Nay, and though I saw this, felt this, and was
broken to pieces with it; yet that which added to my sorrow was,
I could not find, that with all my soul I did desire
deliverance.&nbsp; That scripture did also tear and rend my soul
in the midst of these distractions, <i>The wicked are like the
troubled sea</i>, <i>when it cannot rest</i>, <i>whose waters
cast up mire and dirt</i>.&nbsp; <i>There is no peace</i>,
<i>saith my God</i>, <i>to the wicked</i>.&nbsp; Isa. lvii. 20,
21.</p>
<p><a href="#l105" id="l105">105</a>.&nbsp; And now my heart was, at times, exceeding hard; if
I would have given a thousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed
one: no nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one.&nbsp; I was much
dejected, to think that this would be my lot.&nbsp; I saw some
could mourn and lament their sin; and others again, could rejoice
and bless God for Christ; and others again, could quietly talk
of, and with gladness remember the word of God; while I only was
in the storm or tempest.&nbsp; This much sunk me, I thought my
condition was alone, I should therefore much bewail my hard hap,
but get out of, or get rid of these things, I could not.</p>
<p><a href="#l106" id="l106">106</a>.&nbsp; While this temptation lasted, which was about a
year, I could attend upon none of the ordinances of God, but with
sore and great affliction.&nbsp; Yea, then I was most distressed
with blasphemies.&nbsp; If I had been hearing the word, then
uncleanness, blasphemies and despair would hold me a captive
there: if I have been reading, then sometimes I had sudden
thoughts to question all I read: sometimes again, my mind would
be so strangely snatched away, and possessed with other things,
that I have neither known, nor regarded, nor remembered so much
as the sentence that but now I have read.</p>
<p><a href="#l107" id="l107">107</a>.&nbsp; In prayer also I have been greatly troubled at this
time; sometimes I have thought I have felt him behind me pulling
my clothes: he would be also continually at me in time of prayer,
to have done, break off, make haste, you have prayed enough, and
stay no longer; still drawing my mind away.&nbsp; Sometimes also
he would cast in such wicked thoughts as these; that I must pray
to him, or for him: I have thought sometimes of that, <i>Fall
down</i>; or, <i>if thou wilt fall down and worship me</i>.&nbsp;
Matt. iii. 9.</p>
<p><a href="#l108" id="l108">108</a>.&nbsp; Also, when because I have had wandering thoughts in
the time of this duty, I have laboured to compose my mind, and
fix it upon God; then with great force hath the tempter laboured
to distract me, and confound me, and to turn away my mind, by
presenting to my heart and fancy, the form of a bush, a bull, a
besom, or the like, as if I should pray to these: To these he
would also (at sometimes especially) so hold my mind, that I was
as if I could think of nothing else, or pray to nothing else but
to these, or such as they.</p>
<p><a href="#l109" id="l109">109</a>.&nbsp; Yet at times I should have some strong and
heart-affecting apprehensions of God, and the reality of the
truth of His gospel.&nbsp; But, oh! how would my heart, at such
times, put forth itself with unexpressible groanings.&nbsp; My
whole soul was then in every word; I should cry with pangs after
God, that He would be merciful unto me; but then I should be
daunted again with such conceits as these: I should think that
God did mock at these my prayers, saying, and that in the
audience of the holy angels, <i>This poor simple wretch doth
hanker after Me</i>, <i>as if I had nothing to do with My
mercy</i>, <i>but to bestow it on such as he</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Alas</i>, <i>poor soul</i>! <i>how art thou
deceived</i>!&nbsp; <i>It is not for such as thee to have favour
with the Highest</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l110" id="l110">110</a>.&nbsp; Then hath the tempter come upon me, also, with such
discouragements as these: <i>You are very hot for mercy</i>,
<i>but I will cool you</i>; <i>this frame shall not last
always</i>: <i>many have been as hot as you for a spurt</i>,
<i>but I have quenched their zeal</i> (and with this, such and
such, who were fallen off, would be set before mine eyes).&nbsp;
Then I should be afraid that I should do so too: But, thought I,
I am glad this comes into my mind: well, I will watch, and take
what care I can.&nbsp; <i>Though you do</i>, said Satan, <i>I
shall be too hard for you</i>; <i>I will cool you insensibly</i>,
<i>by degrees</i>, <i>by little and little</i>.&nbsp; <i>What
care I</i>, saith he, <i>though I be seven years in chilling your
heart</i>, <i>if I can do it at last</i>?&nbsp; <i>Continual
rocking will lull a crying child asleep</i>: <i>I will ply it
close</i>, <i>but I will have my end accomplished</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Though you be burning hot at present</i>, <i>I can pull you
from this fire</i>; <i>I shall have you cold before it be
long</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l111" id="l111">111</a>.&nbsp; These things brought me into great straits; for as
I at present could not find myself fit for present death, so I
thought, to live long, would make me yet more unfit; for time
would make me forget all, and wear even the remembrance of the
evil of sin, the worth of heaven, and the need I had of the blood
of Christ to wash me, both out of mind and thought: but I thank
Christ Jesus, these things did not at present make me slack my
crying, but rather did put me more upon it (<i>like her who met
with adulterer</i>, Deut. xxii. 26), in which days that was a
good word to me, after I had suffered these things a
while:&mdash;<i>I am persuaded that neither death</i>, <i>nor
life</i>, <i>etc.</i>, <i>shall be able to separate us from the
love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</i>.&nbsp; Rom.
viii. 38, 39.&nbsp; And now I hoped long life would not destroy
me, nor make me miss of heaven.</p>
<p><a href="#l112" id="l112">112</a>.&nbsp; Yet I had some supports in this temptation, though
they were then all questioned by me; that in <i>Jer. iii.</i> at
the first was something to me; and so was the consideration of
verse 5 of that chapter; that though we have spoken and done as
evil things as we could, yet we should cry unto God, <i>My
Father</i>, <i>Thou art the Guide of my youth</i>, and shall
return unto Him.</p>
<p><a href="#l113" id="l113">113</a>.&nbsp; I had, also, once a sweet glance from that in 2
Cor. v. 21:<i> For He hath made Him to be sin for us</i>, <i>Who
knew no sin</i>, <i>that we might be made the righteousness of
God in Him</i>.&nbsp; I remember that one day, as I was sitting
in a neighbour&rsquo;s house, and there very sad at the
consideration of my many blasphemies; and as I was saying in my
mind, <i>What ground have I to say that</i>, <i>who have been so
vile and abominable</i>, <i>should ever inherit eternal
life</i>?&nbsp; That word came suddenly upon me, <i>What shall we
say to these things</i>?&nbsp; <i>If God be for us</i>, <i>who
can be against us</i>? Rom. viii. 31.&nbsp; That also was an help
unto me, <i>Because I live</i>, <i>ye shall live also</i>.&nbsp;
John xiv. 19.&nbsp; But these words were but hints, touches, and
short visits, though very sweet when present; only they lasted
not; but, <i>like to</i> Peter&rsquo;s <i>sheet</i>, <i>of a
sudden were caught up from me</i>, <i>to heaven again</i>.&nbsp;
Acts x. 16.</p>
<p><a href="#l114" id="l114">114</a>.&nbsp; But afterwards the Lord did more fully and
graciously discover Himself unto me, and indeed, did quite, not
only deliver me from the guilt that, by these things was laid
upon my conscience, but also from the very filth thereof; for the
temptation was removed, and I was put into my right mind again,
as other Christians were.</p>
<p><a href="#l115" id="l115">115</a>.&nbsp; I remember that one day, as I was travelling into
the country, and musing on the wickedness and blasphemy of my
heart, and considering the enmity that was in me to God, that
scripture came into my mind, <i>Having made peace through the
blood of His cross</i>.&nbsp; Col. i. 20.&nbsp; By which I was
made to see, both again and again, that God and my soul were
friends by His blood; yea, I saw that the justice of God, and my
sinful soul could embrace and kiss each other, through His
blood.&nbsp; This was a good day to me; I hope I shall never
forget it.</p>
<p><a href="#l116" id="l116">116</a>.&nbsp; At another time, as I sat by the fire in my house,
and was musing on my wretchedness, the Lord made that also a
precious word unto me, <i>Forasmuch then as the children are
partakers of flesh and blood</i>, <i>He also Himself likewise
took part of the same</i>, <i>that through death He might destroy
him that had the power of death</i>, <i>that is the devil</i>;
<i>and deliver those who through fear of death</i>, <i>were all
their lifetime subject to bondage</i>.&nbsp; Heb. ii. 14,
15.&nbsp; I thought that the glory of these words was then so
weighty on me, that I was both once and twice ready to swoon as I
sate; yet not with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and
peace.</p>
<p><a href="#l117" id="l117">117</a>.&nbsp; At this time also I sate under of holy Mr
<i>Gifford</i>, whose doctrine, by God&rsquo;s grace, was much
for my stability.&nbsp; This man made it much his business to
deliver the people of God from all those false and unsound tests,
that by nature we are prone to.&nbsp; He would bid us take
special heed, that we took not up any truth upon trust; as from
this, or that, or any other man or men; but to cry mightily to
God, that He would convince us of the reality thereof, and set us
down therein by His own Spirit in the holy word; <i>For</i>, said
he, <i>if you do otherwise</i>, <i>when temptations come</i>,
<i>if strongly</i>, <i>you not having received them with evidence
from heaven</i>, <i>will find you want that help and strength now
to resist</i>, <i>that once you thought you had</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l118" id="l118">118</a>.&nbsp; This was as seasonable to my soul, as the former
and latter rains in their season (for I had found, and that by
sad experience, the truth of these his words: for I had felt
<i>no man can say</i>, especially when tempted by the devil,
<i>that Jesus Christ is Lord</i>, <i>but by the Holy
Ghost</i>).&nbsp; Wherefore I found my soul, through grace, very
apt to drink in this doctrine, and to incline to pray to God,
that in nothing that pertained to God&rsquo;s glory, and my own
eternal happiness, He would suffer me to be without the
confirmation thereof from heaven; for now I saw clearly, there
was an exceeding difference betwixt the notion of the flesh and
blood, and the revelations of God in heaven: also a great
difference betwixt that faith that is feigned, and according to
man&rsquo;s wisdom, and that which comes by a man&rsquo;s being
born thereto of God.&nbsp; Matt. xvi. 15; 1 John v. 1.</p>
<p><a href="#l119" id="l119">119</a>.&nbsp; But, oh! now, how was my soul led from truth to
truth by God!&nbsp; Even from the birth and cradle of the Son of
God, to His accession, and second coming from heaven to judge the
world!</p>
<p><a href="#l120" id="l120">120</a>.&nbsp; Truly, I then found, upon this account, the great
God was very good unto me; for, to my remembrance, there was not
any thing that I then cried unto God to make known, and reveal
unto me, but He was pleased to do it for me; I mean, not one part
of the gospel of the Lord Jesus, but I was orderly led into it:
methought I saw with great evidence, from the relation of the
four evangelists, the wonderful work of God, in giving Jesus
Christ to save us, from His conception and birth, even to His
second coming to judgment: methought I was as if I had seen Him
born, as if I had seen Him grow up; as if I had seen Him walk
through this world, from the cradle to the cross; to which also,
when He came, I saw how gently He gave Himself to be hanged, and
nailed on it for my sins and wicked doings.&nbsp; Also as I was
musing on this His progress, that dropped on my spirit, <i>He was
ordained for the slaughter</i>.&nbsp; 1 Peter i. 12, 20.</p>
<p><a href="#l121" id="l121">121</a>.&nbsp; When I have considered also the truth of His
resurrection, and have remembered that word, <i>Touch Me not</i>,
<i>Mary</i>, etc., I have seen as if He had leaped out of the
grave&rsquo;s mouth, for joy that He was risen again, and had got
the conquest over our dreadful foes.&nbsp; John xx. 17.&nbsp; I
have also in the spirit, seen Him a man, on the right hand of God
the Father for me; and have seen the manner of His coming from
heaven, to judge the world with glory, and have been confirmed in
these things by these scriptures following, Acts i. 9, 10, and
vii. 56, and x. 42; Heb. vii. 24 and ix. 28; Rev. i. 18; 1 Thess.
iv. 17, 18.</p>
<p><a href="#l112" id="l112">112</a>.&nbsp; Once I was troubled to know whether the Lord Jesus
was man as well as God, and God as well as man: and truly, in
those days, let men say what they would, unless I had it with
evidence from heaven, all was nothing to me; I counted myself not
set down in any truth of God.&nbsp; Well, I was much troubled
about this point, and could not tell how to be resolved; at last,
that in Rev. v. 6 came into my mind: <i>And I beheld</i>,
<i>and</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>in the midst of the throne</i>, <i>and
of the four beasts</i>, <i>and in the midst of the elders</i>,
<i>stood a Lamb</i>, <i>as it had been slain</i>.&nbsp; In the
midst of the throne, thought I, there is the Godhead; in the
midst of the elders, there is His manhood; but, oh! methought
this did glister!&nbsp; It was a goodly touch, and gave me sweet
satisfaction.&nbsp; That other scripture also did help me much in
this, <i>For unto us a Child is born</i>, <i>unto us a Son is
given</i>; <i>and the government shall be upon His shoulder</i>:
<i>and His name shall be called Wonderful</i>, <i>Counsellor</i>,
<i>the Mighty God</i>, <i>the Everlasting Father</i>, <i>the
Prince of Peace</i>, etc.&nbsp; Isa. ix. 6.</p>
<p><a href="#l123" id="l123">123</a>.&nbsp; Also besides these teachings of God in His word,
the Lord made use of two things to confirm me in this truth; the
one was the errors of the Quakers and the other was the guilt of
sin; for as the Quakers did oppose this truth, so God did the
more confirm me in it, by leading me into the scripture that did
wonderfully maintain it.</p>
<p><a href="#l124" id="l124">124</a>. The errors that this people then maintained,
were:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;1.&nbsp; That the holy scriptures were not the word of
God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2.&nbsp; That every man in the world had the spirit of
Christ, grace, faith, etc.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3.&nbsp; That Christ Jesus, as crucified, and dying
sixteen hundred years ago, did not satisfy divine justice for the
sins of the people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4.&nbsp; That Christ&rsquo;s flesh and blood were
within the saints.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5.&nbsp; That the bodies of the good and bad that are
buried in the church-yard, shall not arise again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6.&nbsp; That the resurrection is past with good men
already.</p>
<p>&lsquo;7.&nbsp; That that man Jesus, that was crucified
between two thieves, on mount <i>Calvary</i>, in the land of
<i>Canaan</i>, by <i>Jerusalem</i>, was not ascended above the
starry heavens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;8.&nbsp; That He should not, even the same Jesus that
died by the hands of the Jews, come again at the last day; and as
man, judge all nations,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p><a href="#l125" id="l125">125</a>.&nbsp; Many more vile and abominable things were in those
days fomented by them, by which I was driven to a more narrow
search of the scriptures, and was through their light and
testimony, not only enlightened, but greatly confirmed and
comforted in the truth: And, as I said, the guilt of sin did help
me much; for still as that would come upon me, the blood of
Christ did take it off again, and again, and again; and that too
sweetly, according to the scripture.&nbsp; <i>O friends</i>!
<i>cry to God to reveal Jesus Christ unto you</i>; <i>there is
none teacheth like Him</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l126" id="l126">126</a>.&nbsp; It would be too long here to stay, to tell you in
particular, how God did set me down in all the things of Christ,
and how He did, that He might so do, lead me into His words; yea,
and also how He did open them unto me, and make them shine before
me, and cause them to dwell with me, talk with me, and comfort me
over and over, both of His own being, and the being of His Son,
and Spirit, and word, and gospel.</p>
<p><a href="#l127" id="l127">127</a>.&nbsp; Only this, as I said before, I will say unto you
again, that in general, He was pleased to take this course with
me; first, to suffer me to be afflicted with temptations
concerning them, and then reveal them unto me; as sometimes I
should lie under great guilt for sin, even crushed to the ground
therewith; and then the Lord would show me the death of Christ;
yea, so sprinkle my conscience with His blood, that I should
find, and that before I was aware, that in that conscience, where
but just now did reign and rage the law, even there would rest
and abide the peace and love of God, through Christ.</p>
<p><a href="#l128" id="l128">128</a>.&nbsp; Now I had an evidence, as I thought, of my
salvation, from heaven, with many golden seals thereon, all
hanging in my sight.&nbsp; Now could I remember this
manifestation, and the other discovery of grace, with comfort;
and should often long and desire that the last day were come,
that I might be for ever inflamed with the sight, and joy, and
communion of Him, Whose head was crowned with thorns, Whose face
was spit upon, and body broken, and soul made an offering for my
sins.&nbsp; For whereas before I lay continually trembling at the
mouth of hell, now methought I was got so far therefrom, that I
could not, when I looked back, scarce discern it!&nbsp; And oh!
thought I, that I were fourscore years old now, that I might die
quickly, that my soul might be gone to rest.</p>
<p><a href="#l129" id="l129">129</a>.&nbsp; But before I had got thus far out of these my
temptations, I did greatly long to see some ancient godly
man&rsquo;s experience, who had writ some hundreds of years
before I was born; for those who had writ in our days, I thought
(but I desire them now to pardon me) that they had writ only that
which others felt; or else had, through the strength of their
wits and parts, studied to answer such objections as they
perceived others were perplexed with, without going down
themselves into the deep.&nbsp; Well, after many such longings in
my mind, the God, in Whose hands are all our days and ways, did
cast into my hand (one day) a book of <i>Martin
Luther&rsquo;s</i>; it was his Comment on the <i>Galatians</i>;
it also was so old, that it was ready to fall piece from piece if
I did but turn it over.&nbsp; Now I was pleased much that such an
old book had fallen into my hand, the which when I had but a
little way perused, I found my condition in his experience so
largely and profoundly handled, as if his book had been written
out of my heart.&nbsp; This made me marvel: for thus thought I,
<i>This man could not know any thing of the state of Christians
now</i>, <i>but must needs write and speak the experience of
former days</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l130" id="l130">130</a>.&nbsp; Besides, he doth most gravely also in that book,
debate of the rise of these temptations, namely, blasphemy,
desperation, and the like; showing that the law of <i>Moses</i>,
as well as the devil, death, and hell, hath a very great hand
therein: the which, at first, was very strange to me; but
considering and watching, I found it so indeed.&nbsp; But of
particulars here, I intend nothing; only this methinks I must let
fall before all men&mdash;I do prefer this book of <i>Martin
Luther</i> upon the <i>Galatians</i> (excepting the Holy Bible)
before all the books that ever I had seen, as most fit for a
wounded conscience.</p>
<p><a href="#l131" id="l131">131</a>.&nbsp; And now I found, as I thought, that I loved Christ
dearly: Oh! methought my soul cleaved unto Him, my affections
cleaved unto Him; I felt love to Him as hot as fire; and now, as
<i>Job</i> said, <i>I thought I should die in my nest</i>; but I
did quickly find, that my great love was but little; and that I,
who had, as I thought, such burning love to Jesus Christ, could
let Him go again for a very trifle,&mdash;God can tell how to
abase us, and can hide pride from man.&nbsp; Quickly after this
my love was tried to purpose.</p>
<p><a href="#l132" id="l132">132</a>.&nbsp; For after the Lord had, in this manner, thus
graciously delivered me from this great and sore temptation, and
had set me down so sweetly in the faith of His holy gospel, and
had given me such strong consolation and blessed evidence from
heaven, touching my interest in His love through Christ; the
tempter came upon me again, and that with a more grievous and
dreadful temptation than before.</p>
<p><a href="#l133" id="l133">133</a>. And that was, <i>To sell and part with this most blessed
Christ</i>, <i>to exchange Him for the things of this life</i>,
<i>for any thing</i>.&nbsp; The temptation lay upon me for the
space of a year, and did follow me so continually, that I was not
rid of it one day in a month: no, not sometimes one hour in many
days together, unless when I was asleep.</p>
<p><a href="#l134" id="l134">134</a>.&nbsp; And though, in my judgment, I was persuaded, that
those who were once effectually in Christ (as I hoped, through
His grace, I had seen myself) could never lose Him for ever;
<i>The land shall not be sold for ever</i>, <i>for the land is
mine</i>, saith God.&nbsp; Lev. xxv. 23.&nbsp; Yet it was a
continual vexation to me, to think that I should have so much as
one such thought within me against a Christ, a Jesus, that had
done for me as He had done; and yet then I had almost none
others, but such blasphemous ones.</p>
<p><a href="#l135" id="l135">135</a>.&nbsp; But it was neither my dislike of the thought, nor
yet any desire and endeavour to resist, that in the least did
shake or abate the continuation or force and strength thereof;
for it did always, in almost whatever I thought, intermix itself
therewith, in such sort, that I could neither eat my food, stoop
for a pin, chop a stick, or cast mine eye to look on this or
that, but still the temptation would come, <i>Sell Christ for
this</i>, <i>or sell Christ for that</i>; <i>sell Him</i>,
<i>sell Him</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l136" id="l136">136</a>.&nbsp; Sometimes it would run in my thoughts, not so
little as a hundred times together, <i>Sell Him</i>, <i>sell
Him</i>, <i>sell Him</i>: against which, I may say, for whole
hours together, I have been forced to stand as continually
leaning and forcing my spirit against it, lest haply, before I
were aware, some wicked thought might arise in my heart, that
might consent thereto; and sometimes the tempter would make me
believe I had consented to it; but then I should be, as tortured
upon a rack for whole days together.</p>
<p><a href="#l137" id="l137">137</a>.&nbsp; This temptation did put me to such scares, lest I
should at some times, I say, consent thereto, and be overcome
therewith, that by the very force of my mind, in labouring to
gainsay and resist this wickedness, my very body would be put
into action or motion, by way of pushing or thrusting with my
hands or elbows; still answering, as fast as the destroyer said,
<i>Sell Him</i>; <i>I will not</i>, <i>I will not</i>, <i>I will
not</i>, <i>I will not</i>; <i>no</i>, <i>not for thousands</i>,
<i>thousands</i>, <i>thousands of worlds</i>: thus reckoning,
lest I should, in the midst of these assaults, set too low a
value on Him; even until I scarce well knew where I was, or how
to be composed again.</p>
<p><a href="#l138" id="l138">138</a>.&nbsp; At these seasons he would not let me eat my food at
quiet; but, forsooth, when I was set at the table at my meat, I
must go hence to pray; I must leave my food now, just now, so
counterfeit holy also would this devil be.&nbsp; When I was thus
tempted, I would say in myself, <i>Now I am at meat</i>; <i>let
me make an end</i>.&nbsp; No, said he, <i>you must do it now</i>,
<i>or you will displease God</i>, <i>and despise
Christ</i>.&nbsp; Wherefore I was much afflicted with these
things; and because of the sinfulness of my nature (imagining
that these were impulses from God), I should deny to do it, as if
I denied God, and then should I be as guilty, because I did not
obey a temptation of the devil, as if I had broken the law of God
indeed.</p>
<p><a href="#l139" id="l139">139</a>.&nbsp; But to be brief: one morning as I did lie in my
bed, I was, as at other times, most fiercely assaulted with this
temptation, <i>To sell and part with Christ</i>; the wicked
suggestion still running in my mind, <i>Sell Him</i>, <i>sell
Him</i>, <i>sell Him</i>, <i>sell Him</i>, <i>sell Him</i>, as
fast as a man could speak: against which also, in my mind, as at
other times, I answered, <i>No</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>not for
thousands</i>, <i>thousands</i>, <i>thousands</i>, at least
twenty times together: but at last, after much striving, even
until I was almost out of breath, I felt this thought pass
through my heart, <i>Let Him go</i>, <i>if He will</i>; and I
thought also, that I felt my heart freely consent thereto.&nbsp;
Oh! the diligence of Satan!&nbsp; Oh! the desperateness of
man&rsquo;s heart!</p>
<p><a href="#l140" id="l140">140</a>.&nbsp; Now was the battle won, and down fell I as a bird
that is shot from the top of a tree, into great guilt, and
fearful despair.&nbsp; Thus getting out of my bed, I went moping
into the field; but God knows, with as heavy a heart as mortal
man, I think, could bear; where for the space of two hours, I was
like a man bereft of life; and, as now, past all recovery, and
bound over to eternal punishment.</p>
<p><a href="#l141" id="l141">141</a>.&nbsp; And withal, that scripture did seize upon my soul:
<i>Or profane persons as Esau</i>, <i>who for one morsel of
meat</i>, <i>sold his birthright</i>: <i>for ye know</i>, <i>how
that afterward</i>, <i>when he would have inherited the
blessing</i>, <i>he was rejected</i>; <i>for he found no place of
repentance</i>, <i>though he sought it carefully with
tears</i>.&nbsp; Heb. xii. 16, 17.</p>
<p><a href="#l142" id="l142">142</a>.&nbsp; Now was I as one bound, I felt myself shut up unto
the judgment to come; nothing now, for two years together, would
abide with me, but damnation, and an expectation of damnation: I
say, nothing now would abide with me but this, save some few
moments for relief, as in the sequel you will see.</p>
<p><a href="#l143" id="l143">143</a>.&nbsp; These words were to my soul, like fetters of brass
to my legs, in the continual sound of which I went for several
months together.&nbsp; But about ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock on
that day, as I was walking under an hedge (full of sorrow and
guilt, God knows), and bemoaning myself for this hard hap, that
such a thought should arise within me, suddenly this sentence
rushed in upon me, <i>The blood of Christ remits all
guilt</i>.&nbsp; At this I made a stand in my spirit: with that
this word took hold upon me, <i>The blood of Jesus Christ His
Son</i>, <i>cleanseth us from all sin</i>.&nbsp; 1 John i. 7.</p>
<p><a href="#l144" id="l144">144</a>.&nbsp; Now I began to conceive peace in my soul, and
methought I saw, as if the tempter did leer and steal away from
me, as being ashamed of what he had done.&nbsp; At the same time
also I had my sin, and the blood of Christ, thus represented to
me, That my sin, when compared to the blood of Christ, was no
more to it, than this little clod or stone before me, is to this
vast and wide field that here I see.&nbsp; This gave me good
encouragement for the space of two or three hours; in which time
also, methought, I saw, by faith, the Son of God, as suffering
for my sins: but because it tarried not, I therefore sunk in my
spirit, under exceeding guilt again.</p>
<p><a href="#l145" id="l145">145</a>.&nbsp; But chiefly by the aforementioned scripture
concerning <i>Esau&rsquo;s</i> selling of his birthright; for
that scripture would lie all day long, all the week long, yea,
all the year long in my mind, and hold me down, so that I could
by no means lift up myself; for when I would strive to turn to
this scripture or that, for relief, still that sentence would be
sounding in me; <i>For ye know</i>, <i>how that afterwards</i>,
<i>when he would have inherited the blessing</i>, <i>he found no
place of repentance</i>, <i>though he sought it carefully with
tears</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l146" id="l146">146</a>.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, I should have a touch from that
in Luke xxii. 31, <i>I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
not</i>; but it would not abide upon me; neither could I, indeed,
when I considered my state, find ground to conceive in the least,
that there should be the root of that grace in me, having sinned
as I had done.&nbsp; Now was I tore and rent in an heavy case for
many days together.</p>
<p><a href="#l147" id="l147">147</a>.&nbsp; Then began I with sad and careful heart to consider
of the nature and largeness of my sin, and to search into the
word of God, if I could in any place espy a word of promise, or
any encouraging sentence, by which I might take relief.&nbsp;
Wherefore I began to consider that of Mark iii. 28: <i>All sins
shall be forgiven unto the sons of men</i>, <i>and blasphemies
wherewith soever they shall blaspheme</i>.&nbsp; Which place,
methought at a blush, did contain a large and glorious promise
for the pardon of high offences; but considering the place more
fully, I thought it was rather to be understood, as relating more
chiefly to those who had, while in a natural estate, committed
such things as there are mentioned; but not to me, who had not
only received light and mercy, but that had both after, and also
contrary to that, so slighted Christ as I had done.</p>
<p><a href="#l148" id="l148">148</a>.&nbsp; I feared, therefore, that this wicked sin of mine,
might be that sin unpardonable, of which He there thus
speaketh.&nbsp; <i>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy
Ghost</i>, <i>hath never forgiveness</i>, <i>but is in danger of
eternal damnation</i>.&nbsp; Mark iii. 29.&nbsp; And I did the
rather give credit to this, because of that sentence in the
Hebrews: <i>For you know how that afterwards</i>, <i>when he
would have inherited the blessing</i>, <i>he was rejected</i>;
<i>for he found no place of repentance</i>, <i>though he sought
it carefully with tears</i>.&nbsp; And this stuck always with
me.</p>
<p><a href="#l149" id="l149">149</a>.&nbsp; And now was I both a burthen and a terror to
myself; nor did I ever so know, as now, what it was to be weary
of my life, and yet afraid to die.&nbsp; Oh! how gladly now would
I have been anybody but myself! anything but a man, and in any
condition but my own!&nbsp; For there was nothing did pass more
frequently over my mind, than that it was impossible for me to be
forgiven my transgression, and to be saved from the wrath to
come.</p>
<p><a href="#l150" id="l150">150</a>.&nbsp; And now I began to call again time that was spent;
wishing a thousand times twice told, that the day was yet to come
when I should be tempted to such a sin; concluding with great
indignation, both against my heart, and all assaults, how I would
rather have been torn in pieces, than be found a consenter
thereto.&nbsp; But alas! these thoughts, and wishings, and
resolvings were now too late to help me; this thought had passed
my heart, God hath let me go, and I am fallen.&nbsp; Oh! thought
I, <i>that it were with me as in months past</i>, <i>as in the
days when God preserved me</i>!&nbsp; Job xxix. 2.</p>
<p><a href="#l151" id="l151">151</a>.&nbsp; Then again, being loth and unwilling to perish, I
began to compare my sin with others to see if I could find that
any of those that were saved, had done as I had done.&nbsp; So I
considered <i>David&rsquo;s</i> adultery, and murder, and found
them most heinous crimes; and those too committed after light and
grace received: but yet by considering that his transgressions
were only such as were against the law of <i>Moses</i>, from
which the Lord Christ could, with the consent of His word,
deliver him: but mine was against the gospel; yea, against the
Mediator thereof; I had sold my Saviour.</p>
<p><a href="#l152" id="l152">152</a>.&nbsp; Now again should I be as if racked upon the wheel,
when I considered, that, besides the guilt that possessed me, I
should be so void of grace, so bewitched.&nbsp; What, thought I,
must it be no sin but this?&nbsp; Must it needs be the <i>great
transgression</i>?&nbsp; Ps. xix. 13.&nbsp; Must <i>that wicked
one</i> touch my soul?&nbsp; 1 John v. 18.&nbsp; Oh! what sting
did I find in all these sentences?</p>
<p><a href="#l153" id="l153">153</a>.&nbsp; What, thought I, is there but <i>one</i> sin that
is unpardonable? but <i>one</i> sin that layeth the soul without
the reach of God&rsquo;s mercy; and must I be guilty of
<i>that</i>? must it needs be that?&nbsp; Is there but one
<i>sin</i> among <i>so many</i> millions of sins, for which there
is no forgiveness; and must I commit this?&nbsp; Oh! unhappy
<i>sin</i>!&nbsp; Oh! unhappy <i>man</i>!&nbsp; These things
would so break and confound my spirit, that I could not tell what
to do; I thought at times, they would have broke my wits; and
still, to aggravate my misery, that would run in my mind, <i>You
know</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>that afterwards</i>, <i>when he would
have inherited the blessing</i>, <i>he was rejected</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Oh</i>! <i>no one knows the terrors of those days but
myself</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l154" id="l154">154</a>.&nbsp; After this I began to consider of
<i>Peter&rsquo;s</i> sin, which he committed in denying his
Master: and indeed, this came nighest to mine of any that I could
find, for he had denied his Saviour, as I, after light and mercy
received; yea, and that too, after warning given him.&nbsp; I
also considered, that he did it both once and twice; and that,
after time to consider betwixt.&nbsp; But though I put all these
circumstances together, that, if possible I might find help, yet
I considered again, that his was but <i>a denial of his
Master</i>, but mine was, <i>a selling of my Saviour</i>.&nbsp;
Wherefore I thought with myself, that I came nearer to
<i>Judas</i>, than either to <i>David</i> or <i>Peter</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l155" id="l155">155</a>.&nbsp; Here again my torment would flame out and afflict
me; yea, it would grind me, as it were to powder, to consider the
preservation of God towards others, while I fell into the snare;
for in my thus considering of other men&rsquo;s sins, and
comparing them with mine own, I could evidently see, God
preserved them, notwithstanding their wickedness, and would not
let them, as He had let me, become a son of perdition.</p>
<p><a href="#l156" id="l156">156</a>.&nbsp; But oh! how did my soul at this time prize the
preservation that God did set about His people!&nbsp; Ah, how
safely did I see them walk, whom God had hedged in!&nbsp; They
were within His care, protection, and special providence: though
they were full as bad as I by nature; yet because He loved them,
He would not suffer them to fall without the range of mercy: but
as for me, I was gone, I had done it: He would not preserve me,
nor keep me; but suffered me, because I was a reprobate, to fall
as I had done.&nbsp; Now did those blessed places that speak of
God&rsquo;s keeping His people, shine like the sun before me,
though not to comfort me, yet to show me the blessed state and
heritage of those whom the Lord had blessed.</p>
<p><a href="#l157" id="l157">157</a>.&nbsp; Now I saw, that as God had His hand in all the
providences and dispensations that overtook His elect; so He had
His hand in all the temptations that they had to sin against Him;
not to animate them to wickedness, but to choose their
temptations and troubles for them; and also to leave them for a
time, to such sins only that might not destroy, but humble them;
as might not put them beyond, but lay them in the way of the
renewing His mercy.&nbsp; But oh! what love, what care, what
kindness and mercy did I now see, mixing itself with the most
severe and dreadful of all God&rsquo;s ways to His people!&nbsp;
He would let <i>David</i>, <i>Hezekiah</i>, <i>Solomon</i>,
<i>Peter</i>, and others, fall; but He would not let them fall
into sin unpardonable, nor into hell for sin.&nbsp; Oh! thought
I, these be the men that God hath loved; these be the men that
God, though He chastiseth them, keeps them in safety by Him; and
them whom He makes to abide under the shadow of the
Almighty.&nbsp; But all these thoughts added sorrow, grief, and
horror to me, as whatever I now thought on, it was killing to
me.&nbsp; If I thought how God kept His own, that was killing to
me; if I thought of how I was fallen myself, that was killing to
me.&nbsp; As all things wrought together for the best, and to do
good to them that were the called, according to His purpose, so I
thought that all things wrought for my damage, and for my eternal
overthrow.</p>
<p><a href="#l158" id="l158">158</a>.&nbsp; Then again I began to compare my sin with the sin
of <i>Judas</i>, that, if possible, I might find if mine differed
from that, which in truth is unpardonable: and oh! thought I, if
it should differ from it, though but the breadth of an hair, what
a happy condition is my soul in!&nbsp; And by considering, I
found that <i>Judas</i> did this intentionally, but mine was
against my prayer and strivings: besides, his was committed with
much deliberation, but mine in a fearful hurry, on a sudden: all
this while I was tossed to and fro like the locusts, and driven
from trouble to sorrow; hearing always the sound of
<i>Esau&rsquo;s</i> fall in mine ears, and the dreadful
consequences thereof.</p>
<p><a href="#l159" id="l159">159</a>.&nbsp; Yet this consideration about <i>Judas&rsquo;s</i>
sin was, for awhile, some little relief to me; for I saw I had
not, as to the circumstances, transgressed so fully as he.&nbsp;
But this was quickly gone again, for I thought with myself, there
might be more ways than one to commit this unpardonable sin; also
I thought there might be degrees of that, as well as of other
transgressions; wherefore, for aught I yet could perceive, this
iniquity of mine might be such, as might never be passed by.</p>
<p><a href="#l160" id="l160">160</a>.&nbsp; I was often now ashamed that I should be like such
an ugly man as Judas: I thought also how loathsome I should be
unto all the saints at the day of judgment: insomuch that now I
could scarce see a good man, that I believed had a good
conscience, but I should feel my heart tremble at him, while I
was in his presence.&nbsp; Oh! now I saw a glory in walking with
God, and what a mercy it was to have a good conscience before
Him.</p>
<p><a href="#l161" id="l161">161</a>.&nbsp; I was much about that time tempted to content
myself by receiving some false opinion; as, that there should be
no such thing as a day of judgment; that we should not rise
again; and that sin was no such grievous thing: the tempter
suggesting thus: <i>For if these things should indeed be
true</i>, <i>yet to believe otherwise would yield you ease for
the present</i>.&nbsp; <i>If you must perish</i>, <i>never
torment yourself so much beforehand</i>: <i>drive the thoughts of
damning out of your mind</i>, <i>by possessing your mind with
some such conclusions that</i> Atheists <i>and</i> Ranters <i>use
to help themselves withal</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l162" id="l162">162</a>.&nbsp; But oh! when such thoughts have led through my
heart, how, as it were, within a step, hath death and judgment
been in my view! methought the judge stood at the door; I was as
if it was come already; so that such things could have no
entertainment.&nbsp; But methinks, I see by this, that Satan will
use any means to keep the soul from Christ; he loveth not an
awakened frame of spirit; security, blindness, darkness, and
error, is the very kingdom and habitation of the wicked one.</p>
<p><a href="#l163" id="l163">163</a>.&nbsp; I found it a hard work now to pray to God, because
despair was swallowing me up; I thought I was as with a tempest
driven away from God; for always when I cried to God for mercy,
this would come in, &rsquo;<i>Tis too late</i>, <i>I am lost</i>,
<i>God hath let me fall</i>; <i>not to my correction</i>, <i>but
condemnation</i>: <i>my sin is unpardonable</i>; <i>and I
know</i>, <i>concerning Esau</i>, <i>how that after he had sold
his birthright</i>, <i>he would have received the blessing</i>,
<i>but was rejected</i>.&nbsp; About this time I did light on
that dreadful story of that miserable mortal Francis Spira; a
book that was to my troubled spirit, as salt, when rubbed into a
fresh wound: every sentence in that book, every groan of that
man, with all the rest of his actions in his dolours, as his
tears, his prayers, his gnashing of teeth, his wringing of hands,
his twining and twisting, and languishing, and pining away under
that mighty hand of God that was upon him, were as knives and
daggers in my soul; especially that sentence of his was frightful
to me, <i>Man knows the beginning of sin</i>? <i>but who bounds
the issues thereof</i>?&nbsp; Then would the former sentence, as
the conclusion of all, fall like an hot thunderbolt again upon my
conscience; <i>For you know how that afterwards</i>, <i>when he
would have inherited the blessing</i>, <i>he was rejected</i>;
<i>for he found no place of repentance</i>, <i>though he sought
it carefully with tears</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l164" id="l164">164</a>.&nbsp; Then should I be struck into a very great
trembling, insomuch that at sometimes I could, for whole days
together, feel my very body, as well as my mind, to shake and
totter under the sense of this dreadful judgment of God, that
should fall on those that have sinned that most fearful and
unpardonable sin.&nbsp; I felt also such a clogging and heat at
my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was, especially
at some times, as if my breast-bone would split asunder; then I
thought of that concerning Judas, who by <i>falling headlong</i>,
<i>he burst asunder in the midst</i>, <i>and all his bowels
gushed out</i>.&nbsp; Acts i. 18.</p>
<p><a href="#l165" id="l165">165</a>.&nbsp; I feared also that this was the mark that the Lord
did set on <i>Cain</i>, even continual fear and trembling, under
the heavy load of guilt that he had charged on him for the blood
of his brother <i>Abel</i>.&nbsp; Thus did I wind, and twine, and
shrink under the burthen that was upon me; which burthen also did
so oppress me, that I could neither stand, nor go, nor lie,
either at rest or quiet.</p>
<p><a href="#l166" id="l166">166</a>.&nbsp; Yet that saying would sometimes come into my mind,
<i>He hath received gifts for the rebellious</i>.&nbsp; Psalm
lxviii. 18.&nbsp; The <i>rebellious</i>, thought I! why surely
they are such as once were under subjection to their Prince; even
those who after they have sworn subjection to His government,
have taken up arms against Him; and this, thought I, is my very
condition: I once loved Him, feared Him, served Him; but now I am
a rebel; I have sold Him, I have said, <i>Let Him go</i>, <i>if
He will</i>; but yet He has gifts for rebels; and then why not
for me?</p>
<p><a href="#l167" id="l167">167</a>.&nbsp; This sometimes I thought on, and should labour to
take hold thereof, that some, though small refreshment, might
have been conceived by me; but in this also I missed of my
desire; I was driven with force beyond it; I was like a man going
to execution, even by <i>that</i> place where he would fain creep
in and hide himself, but may not.</p>
<p><a href="#l168" id="l168">168</a>.&nbsp; Again, after I had thus considered the sins of the
<i>saints</i> in particular, and found <i>mine</i> went beyond
them, then I began to think with myself, Set the case I should
put <i>all theirs</i> together, and <i>mine alone</i> against
them, might I not then find some encouragement? for if
<i>mine</i>, though bigger than any one, yet should be but equal
to all, then there is hopes; for that blood that hath virtue
enough in it to wash away all theirs, had virtue enough in it to
do away mine, though this one be full as big, if not bigger than
all theirs.&nbsp; Here again, I should consider the sin of
<i>David</i>, of <i>Solomon</i>, of <i>Manasseh</i>, of
<i>Peter</i>, and the rest of the great offenders; and should
also labour, what I might with fairness, to aggravate and
heighten their sins by several circumstances.</p>
<p><a href="#l169" id="l169">169</a>.&nbsp; I should think with myself that <i>David</i> shed
blood to cover his adultery, and that by the sword of the
children of <i>Ammon</i>; a work that could not be done, but by
continuance, deliberate contrivance, which was a great
aggravation to his sin.&nbsp; But then this would turn upon me:
Ah! but these were but sins against the law, from which there was
a Jesus sent to save them; but yours is a sin against the
Saviour, and who shall save you from that?</p>
<p><a href="#l170" id="l170">170</a>.&nbsp; Then I thought on <i>Solomon</i>, and how he sinned
in loving strange women, falling away to their idols, in building
them temples, in doing this after light, in his old age, after
great mercy received: but the same conclusion that cut me off in
the former consideration, cut me off as to this; namely, that all
those were but sins against the law, for which God had provided a
remedy; <i>but I had sold my Saviour</i>, and there remained no
more sacrifice for sin.</p>
<p><a href="#l171" id="l171">171</a>.&nbsp; I would then add to these men&rsquo;s sins, the
sins of <i>Manasseh</i>; how that he built altars for idols in
the house of the Lord; he also observed times, used enchantments,
had to do with wizards, was a wizard, had his familiar spirits,
burned his children in the fire in sacrifice to devils, and made
the streets of <i>Jerusalem</i> run down with the blood of
innocents.&nbsp; These, thought I, are great sins, sins of a
bloody colour, but yet it would turn again upon me, <i>They are
none of them of the nature of yours</i>; <i>you have parted with
Jesus</i>, <i>you have sold your Saviour</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l172" id="l172">172</a>.&nbsp; This one consideration would always kill my heart,
<i>my sin was point blank against my Saviour</i>; and that too,
at that height, that I had in my heart said of Him, <i>Let Him
go</i>, <i>if He will</i>.&nbsp; Oh! methought this sin was
bigger than the sins of a country, of a kingdom, or of the whole
world, <i>no</i> one pardonable; nor <i>all</i> of them together,
was able to equal mine; mine out-went them every one.</p>
<p><a href="#l173" id="l173">173</a>.&nbsp; Now I should find my mind to flee from God, as from
the face of a dreadful judge, yet this was my torment, I could
not escape His hand: (<i>It is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God</i>.&nbsp; Hebrew x.)&nbsp; But, blessed
be His grace, that scripture, in these flying fits, would call,
as running after me, <i>I have blotted out</i>, <i>as a thick
cloud</i>, <i>thy transgressions</i>; <i>and as a cloud</i>,
<i>thy sins</i>: <i>return unto Me</i>, <i>for I have redeemed
thee</i>.&nbsp; Isaiah xliv. 22.&nbsp; This, I say, would come in
upon my mind, when I was fleeing from the face of God; for I did
flee from His face; that is, my mind and spirit fled before Him;
by reason of His highness, I could not endure: then would the
text cry, <i>Return unto Me</i>; it would cry aloud with a very
great voice, <i>Return unto Me</i>, <i>for I have redeemed
thee</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, this would make me make a little stop,
and, as it were, look over my shoulder behind me, to see if I
could discern that the God of grace did follow me with a pardon
in His hand; but I could no sooner do that, but all would be
clouded and darkened again by that sentence, <i>For you know</i>,
<i>how that afterwards</i>, <i>when he would have inherited the
blessing</i>, <i>he found no place of repentance</i>, <i>though
he sought it carefully with tears</i>.&nbsp; Wherefore I could
not refrain, but fled, though at some times it cried,
<i>Return</i>, <i>return</i>, as if it did hollow after me: but I
feared to close in therewith, lest it should not come from God;
for that other, as I said, was still sounding in my conscience,
<i>For you know that afterwards</i>, <i>when he would have
inherited the blessing</i>, <i>he was rejected</i>,
<i>etc.</i></p>
<p><a href="#l174" id="l174">174</a>.&nbsp; Once as I was walking to and fro in a good
man&rsquo;s shop, bemoaning of myself in my sad and doleful
state, afflicting myself with self-abhorrence for this wicked and
ungodly thought; lamenting also this hard hap of mine for that I
should commit so great a sin, greatly fearing that I should not
be pardoned; praying also in my heart, that if this sin of mine
did differ from that against the Holy Ghost, the Lord would show
it me.&nbsp; And being now ready to sink with fear, suddenly
there was, as if there had rushed in at the window, the noise of
wind upon me, but very pleasant, and as if I heard a voice
speaking, <i>Did&rsquo;st thou ever refuse to be justified by the
blood of Christ</i>? and withal, my whole life of profession
past, was in a moment opened to me, wherein I was made to see,
that designedly I had not: so my heart answered groaningly,
<i>No</i>.&nbsp; Then fell, with power, that word of God upon me,
<i>See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh</i>.&nbsp; Hebrew
xii. 25.&nbsp; This made a strange seizure upon my spirit; it
brought light with it, and commanded a silence in my heart, of
all those tumultuous thoughts, that did before use, like
masterless hell-hounds, to roar and bellow, and make an hideous
noise within me.&nbsp; It showed me also that Jesus Christ had
yet a word of grace and mercy for me, that He had not, as I had
feared, quite forsaken and cast off my soul; yea, this was a kind
of chide for my proneness to desperation; a kind of threatening
of me, if I did not, notwithstanding my sins, and the heinousness
of them, venture my salvation upon the Son of God.&nbsp; But as
to my determining about this strange dispensation, what it was, I
know not; or from whence it came, I know not; I have not yet in
twenty years&rsquo; time been able to make a judgment of it; <i>I
thought then what here I should be loth to speak</i>.&nbsp; But
verily that sudden rushing wind was, as if an angel had come upon
me; but both it, and the salutation, I will leave until the day
of judgment: only this I say, it commanded a great calm in my
soul; it persuaded me there might be hope: it showed me, as I
thought, what the sin unpardonable was, and that my soul had yet
the blessed privilege to flee to Jesus Christ for mercy.&nbsp;
But I say, concerning this dispensation; I know not yet what to
say unto it; which was also, in truth, the cause, that at first I
did not speak of it in the book; I do now also leave it to be
thought on by men of sound judgment.&nbsp; I lay not the stress
of my salvation thereupon, but upon the Lord Jesus, in the
promise; yet seeing I am here unfolding of my secret things, I
thought it might not be altogether inexpedient to let this also
show itself, though I cannot now relate the matter as there I did
experience it.&nbsp; This lasted in the savour of it for about
three or four days, and then I began to mistrust, and to despair
again.</p>
<p><a href="#l175" id="l175">175</a>.&nbsp; Wherefore still my life hung in doubt before me,
not knowing which way I should tip; only this I found my soul
desire, even to cast itself at the foot of grace, by prayer and
supplication.&nbsp; But oh! &rsquo;twas hard for me now, to have
the face to pray to this Christ for mercy, against Whom I had
thus most vilely sinned: &rsquo;twas hard work, I say, to offer
to look Him in the face, against Whom I had so vilely sinned; and
indeed, I have found it as difficult to come to God by prayer,
after backsliding from Him, as to do any other thing.&nbsp; Oh!
the shame that did now attend me! especially when I thought, I am
now a-going to pray to Him for mercy, that I had so lightly
esteemed but a while before!&nbsp; I was ashamed; yea, even
confounded, because this villany had been committed by me: but I
saw that there was but one way with me; I must go to Him, and
humble myself unto Him, and beg that He, of His wonderful mercy,
would show pity to me, and have mercy upon my wretched sinful
soul.</p>
<p><a href="#l176" id="l176">176</a>.&nbsp; Which, when the tempter perceived, he strongly
suggested to me, <i>That I ought not to pray to God</i>, <i>for
prayer was not for any in my case</i>; <i>neither could it do me
good</i>, <i>because I had rejected the Mediator</i>, <i>by Whom
all prayers came with acceptance to God the Father</i>; <i>and
without Whom</i>, <i>no prayer could come into His presence</i>:
<i>wherefore now to pray</i>, <i>is but to add sin to sin</i>;
<i>yea</i>, <i>now to pray</i>, <i>seeing God has cast you
off</i>, <i>is the next way to anger and offend Him more than you
ever did before</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l177" id="l177">177</a>.&nbsp; <i>For God</i> (saith he) <i>hath been weary of you
for these several years already</i>, <i>because you are none of
His</i>; <i>your bawlings in His ears</i>, <i>hath been no
pleasant voice to Him</i>; <i>and therefore He let you sin this
sin</i>, <i>that you might be quite cut off</i>; <i>and will you
pray still</i>?&nbsp; This the devil urged, and set forth that in
<i>Numbers</i>, when <i>Moses</i> said to the children <i>of
Israel</i>, <i>That because they would not go up to possess the
land</i>, <i>when God would have them</i>, <i>therefore for ever
after He did bar them out from thence</i>, <i>though they prayed
they might with tears</i>.&nbsp; Numbers xiv. 36, 37, etc.</p>
<p><a href="#l178" id="l178">178</a>.&nbsp; As it is said in another place, Exodus xxi. 14,
<i>The man that sins presumptuously shall be taken from
God&rsquo;s altar</i>, <i>that he may die</i>; even as
<i>Joab</i> was by King <i>Solomon</i>, when he thought to find
shelter there.&nbsp; 1 Kings ii. 27, 28, etc.&nbsp; These places
did pinch me very sore; yet my case being desperate, I thought
with myself, I can but die; and if it must be so, it shall once
be said, <i>That such an one died at the foot of Christ in
prayer</i>.&nbsp; This I did, but with great difficulty, God doth
know; and that because, together with this, still that saying
about <i>Esau</i> would be set at my heart, even like a flaming
sword, to keep the way of the tree of life, lest I should take
thereof and live.&nbsp; Oh! who knows how hard a thing I found
it, to come to God in prayer!</p>
<p><a href="#l179" id="l179">179</a>.&nbsp; I did also desire the prayers of the people of God
for me, but I feared that God would give them no heart to do it;
yea I trembled in my soul to think, that some or other of them
would shortly tell me, that God hath said those words to them,
that He once did say to the prophet concerning the children of
Israel, <i>Pray not for this people</i>, <i>for I have rejected
them</i>.&nbsp; Jeremiah xi. 14.&nbsp; So, <i>Pray not for
him</i>, <i>for I have rejected him</i>, yea, I thought that He
had whispered this to some of them already, only they durst not
tell me so; neither durst I ask them of it, for fear if it should
be so, it would make me quite beside myself: <i>Man knows the
beginning of sin</i> (said Spira), <i>but who bounds the issues
thereof</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l180" id="l180">180</a>.&nbsp; About this time I took an opportunity to break my
mind to an ancient Christian, and told him all my case: I told
him also, that I was afraid that I had sinned the sin against the
Holy Ghost; and he told me, <i>He thought so too</i>.&nbsp; Here
therefore I had but cold comfort; but talking a little more with
him, I found him, though a good man, a stranger to much combat
with the devil.&nbsp; Wherefore I went to God again, as well as I
could, for mercy still.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="#l181" id="l181">181</a>.&nbsp; Now also did the tempter begin to mock me in my
misery, saying, <i>That seeing I had thus parted with the Lord
Jesus</i>, <i>and provoked Him to displeasure</i>, <i>Who would
have stood between my soul and the flame of devouring fire</i>,
<i>there was now but one way</i>; <i>and that was</i>, to pray
that God the Father would be a Mediator betwixt His Son and me;
<i>that we might be reconciled again</i>, <i>and that I might
have that blessed benefit in Him</i>, <i>that His blessed saints
enjoyed</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l182" id="l182">182</a>.&nbsp; Then did that scripture seize upon my soul, <i>He
is of one mind</i>, <i>and who can turn Him</i>!&nbsp; Oh! I saw,
it was as easy to persuade Him to make a new world, a new
covenant, or a new Bible, besides that we have already, as to
pray for such a thing.&nbsp; This was to persuade Him, that what
He had done already was mere folly, and persuade Him to alter,
yea, to disannul the whole way of salvation.&nbsp; And then would
that saying rend my soul asunder; <i>Neither is there salvation
in any other</i>; <i>for there is none other name under heaven
given among men whereby we must be saved</i>.&nbsp; Acts iv.
12.</p>
<p><a href="#l183" id="l183">183</a>.&nbsp; Now the most free, and full and gracious words of
the gospel, were the greatest torment to me; yea, nothing so
afflicted me, as the thoughts of Jesus Christ, the remembrance of
a Saviour; because I had cast Him off, brought forth the villany
of my sin, and my loss by it, to mind; nothing did twinge my
conscience like this: every time that I thought of the Lord
Jesus, of His grace, love, goodness, kindness, gentleness,
meekness, death, blood, promises, and blessed exhortations,
comforts, and consolations, it went to my soul like a sword; for
still unto these my considerations of the Lord Jesus, these
thoughts would make place for themselves in my heart: <i>Aye</i>,
<i>this is the Jesus</i>, <i>the loving Saviour</i>, <i>the Son
of God</i>, <i>Whom you have parted with</i>, <i>Whom you have
slighted</i>, <i>despised</i>, <i>and abused</i>.&nbsp; <i>This
is the only Saviour</i>, <i>the only Redeemer</i>, <i>the only
One that could so love sinners</i>, <i>as to wash them from their
sins in His own most precious blood</i>; <i>but you have no part
nor lot in this Jesus</i>: <i>you have put Him from you</i>;
<i>you have said in your heart</i>, Let Him go, if He will.&nbsp;
<i>Now</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>you are severed from Him</i>;
<i>you have severed yourself from Him</i>: <i>behold then His
goodness</i>, <i>but yourself to be no partaker of it</i>.&nbsp;
Oh! thought I, what have I lost, what have I parted with!&nbsp;
What has disinherited my poor soul!&nbsp; Oh! &rsquo;tis sad to
be destroyed by the grace and mercy of God; to have the Lamb, the
Saviour, turn lion and destroyer.&nbsp; Rev. vi.&nbsp; I also
trembled, as I have said, at the sight of the saints of God,
especially at those that greatly loved Him, and that made it
their business to walk continually with Him in this world; for
they did, both in their words, their carriages, and all their
expressions of tenderness and fear to sin against their precious
Saviour, condemn, lay guilt upon, and also add continual
affliction and shame upon my soul.&nbsp; <i>The dread of them was
upon me</i>, <i>and I trembled at God&rsquo;s Samuels</i>.&nbsp;
1 Sam. xvi. 4.</p>
<p><a href="#l184" id="l184">184</a>.&nbsp; Now also the tempter began afresh to mock my soul
another way, saying, <i>That Christ indeed did pity my case</i>,
<i>and was sorry for my loss</i>; <i>but forasmuch as I had
sinned and transgressed as I had done</i>, <i>He could by no
means help me</i>, <i>nor save me from what I feared</i>: <i>for
my sin was not of the nature of theirs</i>, <i>for Whom He bled
and died</i>; <i>neither was it counted with those that were laid
to His charge</i>, <i>when He hanged on a tree</i>:
<i>therefore</i>, <i>unless He should come down from heaven</i>,
<i>and die anew for this sin</i>, <i>though indeed He did greatly
pity me</i>, <i>yet I could have no benefit of Him</i>.&nbsp;
These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as
they were in themselves, but to me they were most tormenting
cogitations: every one of them augmented my misery, that Jesus
Christ should have so much love as to pity me, when yet He could
not help me; nor did I think that the reason why He could not
help me, was, because His merits were weak, or His grace and
salvation spent on others already, but because His faithfulness
to His threatening, would not let Him extend His mercy to
me.&nbsp; Besides, I thought, as I have already hinted, that my
sin was not within the bounds of that pardon, that was wrapped up
in a promise; and if not, then I knew assuredly, that it was more
easy for heaven and earth to pass away, than for me to have
eternal life.&nbsp; So that the ground of all these fears of mine
did arise from a steadfast belief I had of the stability of the
holy word of God, and also from my being misinformed of the
nature of my sin.</p>
<p><a href="#l185" id="l185">185</a>.&nbsp; But oh! how this would add to my affliction, to
conceit that I should be guilty of such a sin, for which He did
not die.&nbsp; These thoughts would so confound me, and imprison
me, and tie me up from faith, that I knew not what to do.&nbsp;
But oh! thought I, that He would come down again!&nbsp; Oh! that
the work of man&rsquo;s redemption was yet to be done by Christ!
how would I pray Him and entreat Him to count and reckon this sin
among the rest for which He died!&nbsp; But this scripture would
strike me down as dead; <i>Christ being raised from the dead</i>,
<i>dieth no more</i>; <i>death hath no more dominion over
Him</i>.&nbsp; Rom. vi. 9.</p>
<p><a href="#l186" id="l186">186</a>.&nbsp; Thus, by the strange and unusual assaults of the
tempter, my soul was like a broken vessel, driven as with the
winds, and tossed sometimes headlong into despair; sometimes upon
the covenant of works, and sometimes to wish that the new
covenant, and the conditions thereof, might so far forth, as I
thought myself concerned, be turned another way, and changed,
<i>But in all these</i>, <i>I was as those that jostle against
the rocks</i>; <i>more broken</i>, <i>scattered and
rent</i>.&nbsp; Oh! the un-thought-of imaginations, frights,
fears, and terrors, that are affected by a thorough application
of guilt yielding to desperation!&nbsp; <i>This is the man that
hath his dwelling among the tombs with the dead</i>; <i>that is
always crying out</i>, <i>and cutting himself with
stones</i>.&nbsp; Mark v. 1, 2, 3.&nbsp; But, I say, all in vain;
desperation will not comfort him, the old covenant will not save
him: nay, heaven and earth shall pass away, before one jot or
tittle of the word and law of grace will fail or be
removed.&nbsp; This I saw, this I felt, and under this I groaned;
yet this advantage I got thereby, namely, a farther confirmation
of the certainty of the way of salvation; and that the scriptures
were the word of God.&nbsp; Oh! I cannot now express what then I
saw and felt of the steadiness of Jesus Christ, the rock of
man&rsquo;s salvation: What was done, could not be undone, added
to, nor altered.&nbsp; I saw, indeed, that sin might drive the
soul beyond Christ, even the sin which is unpardonable; but woe
to him that was so driven, for the word would shut him out.</p>
<p><a href="#l187" id="l187">187</a>.&nbsp; Thus I was always sinking, whatever I did think or
do.&nbsp; So one day I walked to a neighbouring town, and sate
down upon a settle in the street, and fell into a very deep pause
about the most fearful state my sin had brought me to; and after
long musing, I lifted up I sat my head, but methought I saw, as
if the sun that shineth in the heavens did grudge to give light;
and as if the very stones in the street, and tiles upon the
houses, did bend themselves against me.&nbsp; Methought that they
all combined together to banish me out of the world.&nbsp; I was
abhorred of them, and unfit to dwell among them, or be partaker
of their benefits, because I had sinned against the
Saviour.&nbsp; O how happy now was every creature over I
was!&nbsp; For they stood fast, and kept their station, but I was
gone and lost.</p>
<p><a href="#l188" id="l188">188</a>.&nbsp; Then breaking out in the bitterness of my soul, I
said to myself with a grievous sigh, <i>How can God comfort such
a wretch</i>!&nbsp; I had no sooner said it, but this returned
upon me, as an echo doth answer a voice: <i>This sin is not unto
death</i>.&nbsp; At which I was, as if I had been raised out of
the grave, and cried out again, <i>Lord</i>, <i>how couldst Thou
find out such a word as this</i>!&nbsp; For I was filled with
admiration at the fitness, and at the unexpectedness of the
sentence; the fitness of the word, the rightness of the timing of
it; the power, and sweetness, and light, and glory that came with
it also, were marvellous to me to find: I was now, for the time,
out of doubt, as to that about which I was so much in doubt
before; my fears before <i>were</i>, that my sin was not
pardonable, and so that I had no right to pray, to repent, etc.,
or that, if I did, it would be of no advantage or profit to
me.&nbsp; But now, thought I, if <i>this sin</i> is not unto
death, then it is pardonable; therefore from this I have
encouragement to come to God by Christ for mercy, to consider the
promise of forgiveness, as that which stands with open arms to
receive me as well as others.&nbsp; This therefore was a great
easement to my mind, to wit, that my sin was pardonable, that it
was not the sin unto death (1 John v. 16, 17).&nbsp; None but
those that know what my trouble (by their own experience) was,
can tell what relief came to my soul by this consideration: it
was a release to me from my former bonds, and a shelter from the
former storm: I seemed now to stand upon the same ground with
other sinners, and to have as good right to the word and prayer
as any of they.</p>
<p><a href="#l189" id="l189">189</a>.&nbsp; Now I say, I was in hopes that my sin was not
unpardonable, but that there might be hopes for me to obtain
forgiveness.&nbsp; But oh! how Satan did now lay about him for to
bring me down again!&nbsp; But he could by no means do it,
neither this day, nor the most part of the next, for this good
sentence stood like a mill-post at my back: yet towards the
evening of the next day, I felt this word begin to leave me, and
to withdraw its supportation from me, and so I returned to my old
fears again, but with a great deal of grudging and peevishness,
for I feared the sorrow of despair; nor could my faith now long
retain this word.</p>
<p><a href="#l190" id="l190">190</a>.&nbsp; But the next day at evening, being under many
fears, I went to seek the Lord, and as I prayed, I cried, and my
soul cried to Him in these words, with strong cries: <i>O
Lord</i>, <i>I beseech Thee</i>, <i>show me that Thou hast loved
me with everlasting love</i>.&nbsp; Jer. xxxi. 3.&nbsp; I had no
sooner said it, but with sweetness this returned upon me, as an
echo, or sounding again, <i>I have loved thee with an everlasting
love</i>.&nbsp; Now I went to bed in quiet; also when I awakened
the next morning, it was fresh upon my soul; and I believed
it.</p>
<p><a href="#l191" id="l191">191</a>.&nbsp; But yet the tempter left me not; for it could not
be so little as an hundred times, that he that day did labour to
then break my peace.&nbsp; Oh! the combats and conflicts that I
did then meet with; as I strove to hold by this word, that of
<i>Esau</i> would fly in my face like lightning: I should be
sometimes up and down twenty times in an hour; yet God did bear
me up, and keep my heart upon this word; from which I had also,
for several days together, very much sweetness, and comfortable
hopes of pardon: for thus it was made out unto me, <i>I loved
thee whilst thou wast committing this sin</i>, <i>I loved thee
before</i>, <i>I love thee still</i>, <i>and I will love thee for
ever</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l192" id="l192">192</a>.&nbsp; Yet I saw my sin most barbarous, and a filthy
crime, and could not but conclude, and that with great shame and
astonishment, that I had horribly abused the holy Son of God:
wherefore I felt my soul greatly to love and pity Him, and my
bowels to yearn towards Him; for I saw He was still my friend,
and did reward me good for evil; yea, the love and affection that
then did burn within to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, did
work at this time such a strong and hot desire of revengement
upon myself for the abuse I had done unto Him, that to speak as I
then thought, had I had a thousand gallons of blood within my
veins, I could freely then have spilt it all, at the command and
feet of this my Lord and Saviour.</p>
<p><a href="#l193" id="l193">193</a>.&nbsp; And as I was thus in musing, and in my studies,
considering how to love the Lord, and to express my love to Him,
that saying came in upon me, <i>If Thou</i>, <i>Lord</i>,
<i>shouldst mark iniquities</i>, <i>O Lord</i>, <i>who should
stand</i>?&nbsp; <i>But there is forgiveness with Thee</i>,
<i>that Thou mayest be feared</i>.&nbsp; Psalm cxxx. 3, 4.&nbsp;
These were good words to me, especially the latter part thereof;
to wit, that there is forgiveness with the Lord, that He might be
feared; that is, as then I understood it, that He might be loved,
and had in reverence; for it was thus made out to me, <i>That the
great God did set so high an esteem upon the love of His poor
creatures</i>, <i>that rather than He would go without their
love</i>, <i>He would pardon their transgressions</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l194" id="l194">194</a>.&nbsp; And now was that word fulfilled on me, and I was
also refreshed by it; <i>That thou mayest remember and be
confounded</i>, <i>and never open thy mouth any more</i>,
<i>because of thy shame</i>, <i>when I am pacified toward thee
for all that thou hast done</i>, <i>saith the Lord God</i>.&nbsp;
Ezek. xvi. 63.&nbsp; Thus was my soul at this time (and as I then
did think for ever) set at liberty from being afflicted with my
former guilt and amazement.</p>
<p><a href="#l195" id="l195">195</a>.&nbsp; But before many weeks were gone, I began to despond
again, fearing, lest, notwithstanding all that I had enjoyed,
that I might be deceived and destroyed at the last; for this
consideration came strong into my mind, <i>That whatever comfort
and peace I thought I might have from the word of the promise of
life</i>, <i>yet unless there could be found in my
refreshment</i>, <i>a concurrence and agreement in the
scriptures</i>, <i>let me think what I will thereof</i>, <i>and
hold it never so fast</i>, <i>I should find no such thing at the
end</i>; <i>And the scripture cannot be broken</i>.&nbsp; John x.
35.</p>
<p><a href="#l196" id="l196">196</a>.&nbsp; Now began my heart again to ache, and fear I might
meet with a disappointment at last.&nbsp; Wherefore I began with
all seriousness to examine my former comfort, and to consider
whether one that had sinned as I had done, might with confidence
trust upon the faithfulness of God, laid down in those words, by
which I had been comforted, and on which I had leaned myself: but
now were brought those sayings to my mind.&nbsp; <i>For it is
impossible for those who were once enlightened</i>, <i>and have
tasted of the heavenly gift</i>, <i>and were made partakers of
the Holy Ghost</i>, <i>and have tasted the good word of God</i>,
<i>and the powers of the world to come</i>, <i>if they shall fall
away</i>, <i>to renew them again unto repentance</i>.&nbsp; Heb.
vi. 4&ndash;6.&nbsp; <i>For</i>, <i>if we sin wilfully</i>,
<i>after we have received the knowledge of the truth</i>,
<i>there remains no more sacrifice for sin</i>, <i>but a certain
fearful looking for of judgment</i>, <i>and fiery
indignation</i>, <i>which shall devour the adversaries</i>.&nbsp;
Heb. x. 26, 27.&nbsp; <i>As Esau</i>, <i>who for one morsel of
meat</i>, <i>sold his birthright</i>.&nbsp; <i>For ye know how
that afterward</i>, <i>when he would have inherited the
blessing</i>, <i>he was rejected</i>; <i>for he found no place of
repentance</i>, <i>though he sought it carefully with
tears</i>.&nbsp; Heb. xii. 16, 17.</p>
<p><a href="#l197" id="l197">197</a>.&nbsp; Now was the word of the gospel forced from my soul;
so that no promise or encouragement was to be found in the Bible
for me: and now would that saying work upon my spirit to afflict
me, <i>Rejoice not</i>, <i>O Israel</i>, <i>for joy</i>, <i>as
other people</i>.&nbsp; Hos. ix. 1.&nbsp; For I saw indeed, there
was cause of rejoicing for those that held to Jesus; but for me,
I had cut myself off by my transgressions, and left myself
neither foot-hold, or hand-hold, among all the stays and props in
the precious word of life.</p>
<p><a href="#l198" id="l198">198</a>.&nbsp; And truly, I did now feel myself to sink into a
gulph, as an house whose foundation is destroyed; I did liken
myself in this condition, unto the case of some child that was
fallen into a mill-pit, who though it could make some shift to
scramble and sprawl in the water, yet because it could find
neither hold for hand nor foot, therefore at last it must die in
that condition.&nbsp; So soon as this fresh assault had fastened
on my soul, that scripture came into my heart, This <i>for many
days</i>.&nbsp; Dan. x. 14.&nbsp; And indeed I found it was so;
for I could not be delivered, nor brought to peace again, until
well nigh two years and a half were completely finished.&nbsp;
Wherefore these words, though in themselves, they tended to
discouragement, yet to me, who feared this condition would be
eternal, they were at some times as an help and refreshment to
me.</p>
<p><a href="#l199" id="l199">199</a>.&nbsp; For, thought I, <i>many days</i> are not for ever,
<i>many days</i> will have an end; therefore seeing I was to be
afflicted not a few but <i>many days</i>, yet I was glad it was
but <i>for many days</i>.&nbsp; Thus, I say, I would recall
myself sometimes, and give myself an help, for as soon as ever
the words came into my mind, at first, I knew my trouble would be
long, yet this would be but sometimes; for I could not always
think on this, nor ever be helped by it, though I did.</p>
<p><a href="#l200" id="l200">200</a>.&nbsp; Now while the scriptures lay before me, and laid
sin anew at my door, that saying, in Luke xviii. 1, with others,
did encourage me to prayer: then the tempter laid again at me
very sore, suggesting, <i>That neither the mercy of God</i>,
<i>nor yet the blood of Christ</i>, <i>did at all concern me</i>,
<i>nor could they help me for my sin</i>; <i>therefore it was but
in vain to pray</i>.&nbsp; Yet, thought I, <i>I will
pray</i>.&nbsp; <i>But</i>, said the tempter, <i>your sin is
unpardonable</i>.&nbsp; Well, said I, <i>I will pray</i>.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis to no boot, said he.&nbsp; Yet said I, <i>I will
pray</i>.&nbsp; So I went to prayer to God; and while I was at
prayer, I uttered words to this effect: <i>Lord</i>, <i>Satan
tells me</i>, <i>that neither Thy mercy</i>, <i>nor
Christ&rsquo;s blood</i>, <i>is sufficient to save my soul</i>:
<i>Lord</i>, <i>shall I honour Thee most</i>, <i>by believing
Thou wilt</i>, <i>and canst</i>? <i>or him</i>, <i>by believing
Thou neither wilt not nor canst</i>?&nbsp; <i>Lord</i>, <i>I
would fain honour Thee</i>, <i>by believing Thou wilt and
canst</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l201" id="l201">201</a>.&nbsp; And as I was thus before the Lord, that scripture
fastened on my heart (O man, great is thy faith), Matt. xv. 28,
even as if one had clapped me on the back, as I was on my knees
before God: yet I was not able to believe this, that this was a
prayer of faith, till almost six months after; for I could not
think that I had faith, or that there should be a word for me to
act faith on; therefore I should still be, as sticking in the
jaws of desperation, and went mourning up and down in a sad
condition.</p>
<p><a href="#l202" id="l202">202</a>.&nbsp; There was nothing now that I longed for more than
to be put out of doubt, as to this thing in question, and as I
was vehemently desiring to know, if there was indeed hope for me,
these words came rolling into my mind, <i>Will the Lord cast off
for ever</i>? <i>and will He be favourable no more</i>?&nbsp;
<i>Is His mercy clean gone for ever</i>?&nbsp; <i>Doth His
promise fail for evermore</i>?&nbsp; <i>Hath God forgotten to be
gracious</i>?&nbsp; <i>Hath He in anger shut up His tender
mercies</i>?&nbsp; Ps. lxxvii. 7&ndash;9.&nbsp; And all the while
they run in my mind, methought I had still this as the answer,
&rsquo;<i>Tis a question whether He hath or no</i>: <i>it may be
He hath not</i>.&nbsp; Yea, the interrogatory seemed to me to
carry in it a sure affirmation that indeed He had not, nor would
so cast off, but would be favourable: that His promise doth not
fail, and that He had not forgotten to be gracious, nor would in
anger shut up tender mercy.&nbsp; Something also there was upon
my heart at the same time, which I cannot now call to mind,
which, with this text, did sweeten my heart, and make me
conclude, that His mercy might not be quite gone, nor clean gone
for ever.</p>
<p><a href="#l203" id="l203">203</a>.&nbsp; At another time I remembered, I was again much
under this question, <i>Whether the blood of Christ was
sufficient to save my soul</i>? in which doubt I continued from
morning, till about seven or eight at night: and at last, when I
was, as it were, quite worn out with fear, lest it should not lay
hold on me, these words did sound suddenly within my heart: <i>He
is able</i>.&nbsp; But methought, this word <i>able</i>, was
spoke loud unto me; it showed a <i>great word</i>, it seemed to
be writ in <i>great letters</i>, and gave such a jostle to my
fear and doubt (I mean for the time it tarried with me, which was
about a day) as I never had from that, all my life, either before
or after.&nbsp; Heb. vii. 25.</p>
<p><a href="#l204" id="l204">204</a>.&nbsp; But one morning as I was again at prayer, and
trembling under the fear of this, <i>That no word of God could
help me</i>, that piece of a sentence darted in upon me, <i>My
grace is sufficient</i>.&nbsp; At this, methought I felt some
stay, as if there might be hopes.&nbsp; But, oh! how good a thing
it is for God to send His word! for, about a fortnight before, I
was looking on this very place, and then I thought it could not
come near my soul with comfort, therefore I threw down my book in
a pet: then I thought it was not large enough for me; no, not
large enough; but now it was as if it had arms of grace so wide,
that it could not only enclose me, but many more such as I
besides.</p>
<p><a href="#l205" id="l205">205</a>.&nbsp; By these words I was sustained, yet not without
exceeding conflicts, for the space of seven or eight weeks; for
my peace would be in it, and out, sometimes twenty times a day;
comfort now, and trouble presently; peace now, and before I could
go a furlong, as full of fear and guilt as ever heart could
hold.&nbsp; And this was not only now and then, but my whole
seven weeks&rsquo; experience: for this about <i>the sufficiency
of grace</i>, and <i>that</i> of <i>Esau&rsquo;s</i> parting with
his birthright, would be like a pair of scales within my mind;
sometimes one end would be uppermost, and sometimes again the
other; according to which would be my peace or trouble.</p>
<p><a href="#l206" id="l206">206</a>.&nbsp; Therefore I did still pray to God, that He would
come in with this scripture more fully on my heart; to wit, that
He would help me to apply the whole sentence, for as yet I could
not: that He gave, that I gathered; but farther I could not go,
for as yet it only helped me to hope there might be mercy for me;
<i>My grace is sufficient</i>: And though it came no farther, it
answered my former question, to wit, That there was hope; yet
because <i>for thee</i> was left out, I was not contented, but
prayed to God for that also.&nbsp; Wherefore, one day, when I was
in a meeting of God&rsquo;s people, full of sadness and terror;
for my fears again were strong upon me; and, as I was now
thinking, my soul was never the better, but my case most sad and
fearful, these words did with great power suddenly break in upon
me; <i>My grace is sufficient for thee</i>, <i>My grace is
sufficient for thee</i>, <i>My grace is sufficient for thee</i>,
three times together: And oh! methought that every word was a
mighty word unto me; as <i>My</i>, and <i>grace</i>, and
<i>sufficient</i>, and <i>for thee</i>; they were then, and
sometimes are still, far bigger than others be.</p>
<p><a href="#l207" id="l207">207</a>.&nbsp; At which time my understanding was so enlightened,
that I was as though I had seen the Lord Jesus look down from
heaven, through the tiles upon me, and direct these words unto
me.&nbsp; This sent me mourning home; it broke my heart, and
filled me full of joy, and laid me low as the dust; only it
stayed not long with me, I mean in this glory and refreshing
comfort; yet it continued with me for several weeks, and did
encourage me to hope: but as soon as that powerful operation of
it was taken from my heart, that other, about <i>Esau</i>,
returned upon me as before: so my soul did hang as in a pair of
scales again, sometimes up, and sometimes down; now in peace, and
anon again in terror.</p>
<p><a href="#l208" id="l208">208</a>.&nbsp; Thus I went on for many weeks, sometimes comforted,
and sometimes tormented; and especially at sometimes my torment
would be very sore, for all those scriptures forenamed in the
<i>Hebrews</i>, would be set before me, as the only sentences
that would keep me out of heaven.&nbsp; Then again I would begin
to repent that ever that thought went through me; I would also
think thus with myself: <i>Why</i>, <i>how many scriptures are
there against me</i>?&nbsp; <i>There are but three or four</i>;
<i>And cannot God miss them</i>, <i>and save me for all
them</i>?&nbsp; Sometimes again I would think, <i>Oh</i>! <i>if
it were not for these three or four words</i>, <i>now how might I
be comforted</i>!&nbsp; And I could hardly forbear at some times,
to wish them out of the book.</p>
<p><a href="#l209" id="l209">209</a>.&nbsp; Then methought I should see as if both <i>Peter</i>
and <i>Paul</i>, and <i>John</i>, and all the writers, did look
with scorn upon me, and hold me in derision; and as if they had
said unto me, <i>All our words are truth</i>, <i>one of as much
force as another</i>: <i>it is not we that have cut you of</i>,
<i>but you have cast away yourself</i>.&nbsp; <i>There is none of
our sentences that you must take hold upon</i>, <i>but these and
such as these</i>; <i>it is impossible</i>, Heb. vi.; <i>there
remains no more sacrifice for sin</i>, Heb. x.&nbsp; <i>And it
had been better for them not to have known the will of God</i>,
<i>than after they had known it</i>, <i>to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them</i>, 2 Peter ii. 21.&nbsp; <i>For
the Scriptures cannot be broken</i>.&nbsp; John x. 35.</p>
<p><a href="#l210" id="l210">210</a>.&nbsp; These, as the elders of the city of refuge, I saw,
were to be judges both of my case and me, while I stood with the
<i>avenger</i> of blood at my heels, trembling at their gate for
deliverance; also with a thousand fears and mistrusts, I doubted
that they would shut me out for ever.&nbsp; Joshua xx. 3. 4.</p>
<p><a href="#l211" id="l211">211</a>.&nbsp; Thus I was confounded, not knowing what to do, or
how to be satisfied in this question, <i>Whether the scriptures
could agree in the salvation of my soul</i>?&nbsp; I quaked at
the apostles; I knew their words were true, and that they must
stand for ever.</p>
<p><a href="#l212" id="l212">212</a>.&nbsp; And I remember one day, as I was in divers frames
of spirit, and considering that these frames were according to
the nature of several scriptures that came in upon my mind; if
this of grace, then was I quiet; but of that of <i>Esau</i>, then
tormented.&nbsp; Lord, thought I, <i>if both these scriptures
should meet in my heart at once</i>, <i>I wonder which of them
would get the better of me</i>.&nbsp; So methought I had a
longing mind that they might come both together upon me; yea, I
desired of God they might.</p>
<p><a href="#l213" id="l213">213</a>.&nbsp; Well, about two or three days after, so they did
indeed; they bolted both upon me at a time, and did work and
struggle strangely in me for a while; at last that about
<i>Esau&rsquo;s</i> birthright began to wax weak, and withdraw,
and vanish; and this, about the sufficiency of grace prevailed
with peace and joy.&nbsp; And as I was in a muse about this
thing, that scripture came in upon me, <i>Mercy rejoiceth against
judgment</i>.&nbsp; James ii. 13.</p>
<p><a href="#l214" id="l214">214</a>.&nbsp; This was a wonderment to me; yet truly, I am apt to
think it was of God; for the word of the law and wrath, must give
place to the word of life and grace; because, though the word of
condemnation be glorious, yet the word of life and salvation doth
far exceed in glory.&nbsp; 2 Cor. iii. 8&ndash;11.&nbsp;
<i>Mark</i> ix. 5&ndash;7.&nbsp; <i>John</i> vi. 37.&nbsp; Also
that <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i> must both vanish, and leave
Christ and His saints alone.</p>
<p><a href="#l215" id="l215">215</a>.&nbsp; This scripture also did now most sweetly visit my
soul; <i>And him that cometh to Me</i>, <i>I will in no wise cast
out</i>.&nbsp; Oh! the comfort that I had from this word, <i>in
no wise</i>!&nbsp; As who should say, <i>By no means</i>, <i>for
nothing whatever he hath done</i>.&nbsp; But Satan would greatly
labour to pull this promise from me, telling of me, <i>That
Christ did not mean me and such as I</i>, <i>but sinners of a
lower rank</i>, <i>that had not done as I had done</i>.&nbsp; But
I would answer him again, <i>Satan</i>, <i>here is in these words
no such exception</i>; <i>but him that comes</i>, <i>him</i>,
<i>any him</i>: <i>him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast
out</i>.&nbsp; And this I well remember still, that of all the
slights that Satan used to take this scripture from me, yet he
never did so much as put this question, <i>But do you come
aright</i>?&nbsp; And I have thought the reason was, because he
thought I knew full well what coming aright was; for I saw that
to come aright, was to come as I was, a vile and ungodly sinner,
and to cast myself at the feet of mercy, condemning myself for
sin.&nbsp; If ever Satan and I did strive for any word of God in
all my life, it was for this good word of Christ; he at one end,
and I at the other: Oh! what work did we make!&nbsp; It was for
this in <i>John</i>, I say, that we did so tug and strive, he
pulled, and I pulled; but God be praised, I got the better of
him; I got some sweetness from it.</p>
<p><a href="#l216" id="l216">216</a>.&nbsp; But notwithstanding all these helps, and blessed
words of grace, yet that of <i>Esau&rsquo;s</i> selling of his
birthright, would still at times distress my conscience: for
though I had been most sweetly comforted, and that but just
before, yet when that came into my mind, &rsquo;twould make me
fear again: I could not be quite rid thereof, &rsquo;twould every
day be with me: wherefore now I went another way to work, even to
consider the nature of this blasphemous thought, I mean, if I
should take the words at the largest, and give them their own
natural force and scope, even every word therein: so when I had
thus considered, I found, that if they were fairly taken, they
would amount to this; <i>That I had freely left the Lord Jesus
Christ to His choice</i>, <i>whether He would be my Saviour or
no</i>; for the wicked words were these, <i>Let Him go</i>, <i>if
He will</i>.&nbsp; Then that scripture gave me hope, <i>I will
never leave thee</i>, <i>nor forsake thee</i>.&nbsp; Heb. xiii.
5.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Lord,&rsquo; said I, <i>but I have left
Thee</i>.&nbsp; Then it answered again, <i>But I will not leave
thee</i>.&nbsp; For this I thanked God also.</p>
<p><a href="#l217" id="l217">217</a>.&nbsp; Yet I was grievous afraid He should, and found it
exceeding hard to trust Him, seeing I had so offended Him: I
could have been exceeding glad that this thought had never
befallen; for then I thought I could with more ease and freedom
in abundance, have leaned on His grace.&nbsp; I saw it was with
me, as it was with <i>Joseph&rsquo;s</i> brethren; the guilt of
their own wickedness did often fill them with fears that their
brother would at last despise them.&nbsp; Gen. l. 15, 16,
etc.</p>
<p><a href="#l218" id="l218">218</a>.&nbsp; Yet above all the scriptures that I yet did meet
with that in <i>Joshua</i> xx. was the greatest comfort to me,
which speaks of the slayer that was to flee for refuge: <i>And if
the avenger of blood pursue the slayer</i>, then saith
<i>Moses</i>, <i>they that are the elders of the city of refuge
shall not deliver him into his hands</i>, <i>because he smote his
neighbour unwittingly and hated him not aforetime</i>.&nbsp; Oh!
blessed be God for this word: I was convinced that I was the
slayer; and that the avenger of blood pursued me, I felt with
great terror; only now it remained that I inquire whether I have
right to enter the city of refuge: so I found, that he must not,
<i>who lay in wait to shed blood</i>: It was not the wilful
<i>murderer</i>, but he who <i>unwittingly</i> did it, he who did
it unawares; not out of spite, or grudge, or malice, he that shed
it unwittingly: even he who did not <i>hate his neighbour
before</i>.&nbsp; Wherefore,</p>
<p><a href="#l219" id="l219">219</a>.&nbsp; I thought verily I was the man that must enter,
because I had smitten my neighbour <i>unwittingly</i>, <i>and
hated Him not aforetime</i>.&nbsp; I hated Him not aforetime; no,
I prayed unto Him, was tender of sinning against Him; yea, and
against this wicked temptation I had strove for a twelvemonth
before; yea, and also when it did pass through my heart, it did
in spite of my teeth: wherefore I thought I had a right to enter
this city, and the elders, which are the <i>apostles</i>, were
not to deliver me up.&nbsp; This therefore was great comfort to
me, and gave me much ground of hope.</p>
<p><a href="#l220" id="l220">220</a>.&nbsp; Yet being very critical, for my smart had made me
that I knew not what ground was sure enough to bear me, I had one
question that my soul did much desire to be resolved about; and
that was, <i>Whether it be possible for any soul that hath sinned
the unpardonable sin</i>, <i>yet after that to receive</i>,
<i>though but the least</i>, <i>true spiritual comfort from God
though Christ</i>?&nbsp; The which after I had much considered, I
found the answer was, No, they could not; and that for these
reasons:&mdash;</p>
<p><a href="#l221" id="l221">221</a>.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, Because those that have sinned that
sin, they are debarred a share in the blood of Christ; and being
shut out of that, they must needs be void of the least ground of
hope, and so of spiritual comfort; <i>For to such there remains
no more sacrifice for sin</i>.&nbsp; Heb. x. 26, 27.&nbsp;
<i>Secondly</i>, Because they are denied a share in the promise
of life: <i>It shall never be forgiven him neither in this
world</i>, <i>neither in the world to come</i>.&nbsp; Matt. xii.
32.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>, The Son of God excludes them also from
a share in His blessed intercession, being for ever ashamed to
own them, both before His holy Father, and the blessed angels in
heaven.&nbsp; Mark viii.</p>
<p><a href="#l222" id="l222">222</a>.&nbsp; When I had with much deliberation considered of
this matter, and could not but conclude that the Lord had
comforted me, and that too after this my wicked sin: then
methought I durst venture to come nigh unto those most fearful
and terrible scriptures, with which all this while I had been so
greatly affrighted, and on which indeed, before I durst scarce
cast mine eye (yea, had much ado an hundred times, to forbear
wishing them out of the Bible), for I thought they would destroy
me; but now, I say, I began to take some measure of
encouragement, to come close to them to read them, and consider
them, and to weigh their scope and tendency.</p>
<p><a href="#l223" id="l223">223</a>.&nbsp; The which when I began to do, I found their visage
changed: for they looked not so grimly, as before I thought they
did: and first I came to the sixth of the <i>Hebrews</i>, yet
trembling for fear it should strike me; which when I had
considered, I found that the falling there intended, was a
falling <i>quite away</i>; that is as I conceived, a falling from
and absolute denying of the gospel, of remission of sins by Jesus
Christ; for, from them the apostle begins his argument, verses 1,
2, 3, 4.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, I found that this falling away,
must be openly, even in the view of the world, even so as <i>to
put Christ to an open shame</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>, I found
those he there intended, were for ever shut up of God, both in
blindness, hardness, and impenitency: <i>It is impossible they
should be renewed again unto repentance</i>.&nbsp; By all these
particulars, I found to God&rsquo;s everlasting praise, my sin
was not the sin in this place intended.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I confessed I was fallen, but not fallen away;
that is, from the profession of faith in Jesus unto eternal
life.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, I confessed that I had put Jesus Christ to
<i>shame</i> by my sin, but not to open <i>shame</i>; I did not
deny Him before men, nor condemn Him as a fruitless One before
the world.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Nor did I find that God had shut me up, or
denied me to come (though I found it hard work indeed to come) to
Him by sorrow and repentance: blessed be God for unsearchable
grace!</p>
<p><a href="#l224" id="l224">224</a>.&nbsp; Then I considered that in the 10th chapter of the
<i>Hebrews</i>, and found that the <i>wilful sin</i> there
mentioned, is not every wilful sin, but that which doth throw off
Christ, and then His commandments too.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>,
That must be done also openly, before two or three witnesses, to
answer that of the law, <i>verse</i> 28.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>,
This sin cannot be committed, but with great despite done to the
Spirit of Grace; despising both the dissuasions from that sin,
and the persuasions to the contrary.&nbsp; But the Lord knows,
though this my sin was devilish, yet it did not amount to
these.</p>
<p><a href="#l225" id="l225">225</a>.&nbsp; And as touching that in the 12th of the
<i>Hebrews</i>, about <i>Esau&rsquo;s</i> selling of his
birthright; though this was that which killed me, and stood like
a spear against me, yet now I did consider, <i>First</i>, that
his was not a hasty thought against the continual labour of his
mind, but a thought consented to, and put in practice likewise,
and that after some deliberation, Gen. xxv.&nbsp;
<i>Secondly</i>, It was a public and open action, even before his
brother, if not before many more; this made his sin of a far more
heinous nature than otherwise it would have been.&nbsp;
<i>Thirdly</i>, He continued to slight his birthright: <i>He did
eat and drink</i>, <i>and went his way</i>: thus Esau <i>despised
his birthright</i>, yea, twenty years after he was found to
despise it still.&nbsp; And Esau said, <i>I have enough</i>,
<i>my brother</i>, <i>keep that thou hast unto thyself</i>.&nbsp;
Gen. xxxiii. 9.</p>
<p><a href="#l226" id="l226">226</a>.&nbsp; Now as touching this, <i>that</i> Esau <i>sought a
place of repentance</i>; thus I thought: <i>First</i>, This was
not for the <i>birthright</i>, but <i>the blessing</i>: this is
clear from the apostle, and is distinguished by Esau himself;
<i>He took away my birthright</i> (that is, formerly); <i>and
behold now he hath taken away my blessing</i>.&nbsp; Gen. xxvii.
36.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, Now, this being thus considered, I
came again to the apostle, to see what might be the mind of God,
in a New-Testament style and sense concerning <i>Esau&rsquo;s</i>
sin; and so far as I could conceive, this was the mind of God,
<i>that the birthright</i> signified <i>regeneration</i>, and the
<i>blessing</i>, the <i>eternal inheritance</i>; for so the
apostle seems to hint.&nbsp; <i>Lest there be any profane
person</i>, <i>as</i> Esau, <i>who for one morsel of meat sold
his birthright</i>; as if he should say, That shall cast off all
those blessed beginnings of God, that at present are upon him, in
order to a new-birth; lest they become as <i>Esau</i>, even be
rejected <i>afterwards</i>, when they would inherit the
blessing.</p>
<p><a href="#l227" id="l227">227</a>.&nbsp; For many there are, who, in the day of grace and
mercy, despise those things which are indeed the birthright to
heaven, who yet when the deciding day appears, will cry as lord
as <i>Esau</i>, <i>Lord</i>, <i>Lord</i>, <i>open to us</i>; but
then, as <i>Isaac</i> would not repent, no more will God the
Father, but will say, <i>I have blessed these</i>, <i>yea</i>,
and <i>they shall be blessed</i>; but as for you, <i>Depart</i>,
<i>you are the workers of iniquity</i>.&nbsp; Gen. xxvii. 32;
Luke xiii. 25&ndash;27.</p>
<p><a href="#l228" id="l228">228</a>.&nbsp; When I had thus considered these scriptures, and
found that thus to understand them, was not against, but
according to other scriptures; this still added further to my
encouragement and comfort, and also gave a great blow to that
objection, to wit, <i>That the scriptures could not agree in the
salvation of my soul</i>.&nbsp; And now remained only the hinder
part of the tempest, for the thunder was gone beyond me, only
some drops did still remain, that now and then would fall upon
me; but because my former frights and anguish were very sore and
deep, therefore it oft befall me still, as it befalleth those
that have been scared with fire.&nbsp; I thought every voice was,
<i>Fire</i>! <i>fire</i>!&nbsp; Every little touch would hurt my
tender conscience.</p>
<p><a href="#l229" id="l229">229</a>.&nbsp; But one day, as I was passing in the field, and
that too with some dashes on my conscience, fearing lest yet all
was not right, suddenly this sentence fell upon my soul, <i>Thy
righteousness is in heaven</i>; and methought withal, I saw with
the eyes of my soul, Jesus Christ at God&rsquo;s right hand:
there, I say, was my righteousness; so that wherever I was, or
whatever I was doing, God could not say of me, <i>He wants My
righteousness</i>; for that was just before Him.&nbsp; I also saw
moreover, that it was not my good frame of heart that made my
righteousness better, nor yet my bad frame that made my
righteousness worse; for my righteousness was Jesus Christ
Himself, <i>The same yesterday</i>, <i>to-day</i>, <i>and for
ever</i>.&nbsp; Heb. xiii. 8.</p>
<p><a href="#l230" id="l230">230</a>.&nbsp; Now did my chains fall off my legs indeed; I was
loosed from my afflictions and irons; my temptations also fled
away; so that from that time those dreadful scriptures of God
left off to trouble me: now went I also home rejoicing, for the
grace and love of God; so when I came home, I looked to see if I
could find that sentence; <i>Thy righteousness is in heaven</i>,
but could not find such a saying; wherefore my heart began to
sink again, only that was brought to my remembrance, 1 Cor. i.
30, <i>Christ Jesus</i>, <i>who of God is made unto us
wisdom</i>, <i>and righteousness</i>, <i>and sanctification</i>,
<i>and redemption</i>; by this word I saw the other sentence
true.</p>
<p><a href="#l231" id="l231">231</a>.&nbsp; For by this scripture I saw that the Man Christ
Jesus, as He is distinct from us, as touching His bodily
presence, so He is our righteousness and sanctification before
God.&nbsp; Here therefore I lived, for some time, very sweetly at
peace with God through Christ; Oh! methought, Christ! Christ!
there was nothing but Christ that was before my eyes: I was not
now (only) for looking upon this and the other benefits of Christ
apart, as of His blood, burial, or resurrection, but considering
Him as a whole Christ! as He in whom all these, and all His other
virtues, relations, offices and operations met together, and that
He sat on the right hand of God in heaven.</p>
<p><a href="#l232" id="l232">232</a>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas glorious to me to see His exaltation,
and the worth and prevalency of all His benefits, and that
because now I could look from myself to Him and should reckon,
that all those graces of God that now were green on me, were yet
but like those cracked groats and fourpence-halfpennies that rich
men carry in their purses, when their gold is in their trunks at
home: Oh! I saw my gold was in my trunk at home!&nbsp; In Christ
my Lord and Saviour.&nbsp; Now Christ was all; all my wisdom, all
my righteousness, all my sanctification, and all my
redemption.</p>
<p><a href="#l233" id="l233">233</a>.&nbsp; Further, the Lord did also lead me into the mystery
of union with the Son of God; that I was joined to Him, that I
was flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone; and now was that
word sweet to me in Eph. v. 30.&nbsp; By this also was my faith
in Him, as my righteousness, the more confirmed in me; for if He
and I were one, then His righteousness was mine, His merits mine,
His victory also mine.&nbsp; Now could I see myself in heaven and
earth at once: in heaven by my Christ, by my head, by my
righteousness and life, though on earth by my body or person.</p>
<p><a href="#l234" id="l234">234</a>.&nbsp; Now I saw Christ Jesus was looked upon of God; and
should also be looked upon by us, as that common or public
person, in whom all the whole body of His elect are always to be
considered and reckoned; that we fulfilled the law by Him, died
by Him, rose from the dead by Him, got the victory over sin,
death, the devil, and hell, by Him; when He died, we died, and so
of His resurrection.&nbsp; <i>Thy dead men shall live</i>,
<i>together with My dead body shall they arise</i>, saith
He.&nbsp; Isa. xxvi. 19.&nbsp; And again, <i>after two days He
will revive us</i>, <i>and the third day He will raise us up</i>,
<i>and we shall live in His sight</i>.&nbsp; Hosea vi. 2.&nbsp;
Which is now fulfilled by the sitting down of the Son of Man on
the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens; according to that
to the <i>Ephesians</i>, <i>And hath raised us up together</i>,
<i>and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus</i>.&nbsp; Eph. ii. 6.</p>
<p><a href="#l235" id="l235">235</a>.&nbsp; Ah! these blessed considerations and scriptures,
with many others of like nature, were in those days made to
spangle in mine eyes; so that I have cause to say, <i>Praise ye
the Lord</i>.&nbsp; <i>Praise God in His sanctuary</i>, <i>praise
Him in the firmament of His power</i>; <i>praise Him for His
mighty acts</i>: <i>praise Him according to His excellent
greatness</i>.&nbsp; Psalm cl. 1, 2.</p>
<p><a href="#l236" id="l236">236</a>.&nbsp; Having thus in a few words given you a taste of the
sorrow and affliction that my soul went under, by the guilt and
terror that this my wicked thought did lay me under; and having
given you also a touch of my deliverance therefrom, and of the
sweet and blessed comfort that I met with afterwards, which
comfort dwelt about a twelvemonth with my heart, to my
unspeakable admiration: I will now (God willing), before I
proceed any farther, give you in a word or two, what, as I
conceive, was the cause of this temptation; and also after that,
what advantage, at the last, it became unto my soul.</p>
<p><a href="#l237" id="l237">237</a>.&nbsp; For the causes, I conceived they were principally
two: of which two also I was deeply convinced all the time this
trouble lay upon me.&nbsp; The first was, for that I did not,
when I was delivered from the temptation that went before, still
pray to God to to keep me from the temptations that were to come;
for though, as I can say in truth, my soul was much in prayer
before this trial seized me, yet then I prayed only, or at the
most principally, for the removal of present troubles, and for
fresh discoveries of His love in Christ, which I saw afterwards
was not enough to do; I also should have prayed that the great
God would keep me from the evil that was to come.</p>
<p><a href="#l238" id="l238">238</a>.&nbsp; Of this I was made deeply sensible by the prayer of
holy <i>David</i>, who when he was under present mercy, yet
prayed that God would hold him back from sin and temptation to
come; <i>Then</i>, saith he, <i>shall I be upright</i>, <i>and I
shall be innocent from the great transgression</i>.&nbsp; Psalm
xix. 13.&nbsp; By this very word was I galled and condemned quite
through this long temptation.</p>
<p><a href="#l239" id="l239">239</a>.&nbsp; That was also another word that did much condemn me
for my folly, in the neglect of this duty.&nbsp; Heb. iv. 16:
<i>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace</i>,
<i>that we may obtain mercy</i>, <i>and find grace to help in
time of need</i>.&nbsp; This I had not done, and therefore was
thus suffered to sin and fall, according to what is written,
<i>Pray that ye enter not into temptation</i>.&nbsp; And truly
this very thing is to this day of such weight and awe upon me,
that I dare not, when I come before the Lord, go of my knees,
until I intreat Him for help and mercy against the temptations
that are to come; and I do beseech thee, reader, that thou learn
to beware of my negligence, by the afflictions, that for this
thing I did for days, and months, and years, with sorrow
undergo.</p>
<p><a href="#l240" id="l240">240</a>.&nbsp; Another cause of this temptation was, that I had
tempted God; and on this manner did I do it: Upon a time my wife
was great with child, and before her full time was come, her
pangs, as of a woman in travail, were fierce and strong upon her,
even as if she would have fallen immediately in labour, and been
delivered of an untimely birth: now at this very time it was,
that I had been so strongly tempted to question the being of God;
wherefore, as my wife lay crying by me, I said, but with all
secrecy imaginable, even thinking in my heart, <i>Lord</i>, <i>if
Thou wilt now remove this sad affliction from my wife</i>, <i>and
cause that she be troubled no more therewith this night</i> (and
now were her pangs just upon her), <i>then I shall know that Thou
canst discern the most secret thoughts of the heart</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l241" id="l241">241</a>.&nbsp; I had no sooner said it in my heart, but her pangs
were taken from her, and she was cast into a deep sleep, and so
continued till morning; at this I greatly marvelled, not knowing
what to think; but after I had been awake a good while, and heard
her cry no more, I fell asleep also; so when I awaked in the
morning, it came upon me again, even what I had said in my heart
the last night, and how the Lord had showed me, that He knew my
secret thoughts, which was a great astonishment unto me for
several weeks after.</p>
<p><a href="#l242" id="l242">242</a>.&nbsp; Well, about a year and a half afterwards, that
wicked sinful thought, of which I have spoken before, went
through my wicked heart, even this thought, <i>Let Christ go</i>,
<i>if He will</i>: so when I was fallen under the guilt for this,
the remembrance of my other thought, and of the effect thereof,
would also come upon me with this retort, which also carried
rebuke along with it, <i>Now you may see that God doth know the
most secret thoughts of the heart</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#l243" id="l243">243</a>.&nbsp; And with this, that of the passages that were
betwixt the Lord, and His servant <i>Gideon</i>, fell upon my
spirit; how because that <i>Gideon</i> tempted God with his
fleece, both wet and dry, when he should have believed and
ventured upon His word; therefore the Lord did afterwards so try
him, as to send him against an innumerable company of enemies,
and that too, as to outward appearance, without any strength or
help.&nbsp; Judges vi. 7.&nbsp; Thus He served me, and that
justly, for I should have believed His word, and not have put an
<i>if</i> upon the all-seeingness of God.</p>
<p><a href="#l244" id="l244">244</a>.&nbsp; And now to show you something of the advantages
that I also have gained by this temptation: and first, by this I
was made continually to possess in my soul a very wonderful sense
both of the blessing and glory of God, and of His beloved Son; in
the temptation that went before, my soul was perplexed with
unbelief, blasphemy, hardness of heart, questions about the being
of God, Christ, the truth of the word, and certainty of the world
to come: I say, then I was greatly assaulted and tormented with
atheism, but now the case was otherwise; now was God and Christ
continually before my face, though not in a way of comfort, but
in a way of exceeding dread and terror.&nbsp; The glory of the
holiness of God, did at this time break me to pieces; and the
bowels and compassion of Christ did break me as on the wheel; for
I could not consider Him but as a lost and rejected Christ, the
remembrance of which, was as the continual breaking of my
bones.</p>
<p><a href="#l245" id="l245">245</a>.&nbsp; The scriptures also were wonderful things unto me;
I saw that the truth and verity of them were the keys of the
kingdom of heaven; <i>those</i> that the scriptures favour,
<i>they</i> must inherit bliss; but <i>those</i> that they oppose
and condemn, <i>must</i> perish for evermore: Oh! this word,
<i>For the scriptures cannot be broken</i>, would rend the caul
of my heart: and so would that other, <i>Whose sins ye remit</i>,
<i>they are remitted</i>; <i>but whose sins ye retain</i>,
<i>they are retained</i>.&nbsp; Now I saw the apostles to be the
elders of the city of refuge.&nbsp; Joshua xx. 4.&nbsp; Those
that they were to receive in, were received to life; but those
that they shut out, were to be slain by the avenger of blood.</p>
<p><a href="#l246" id="l246">246</a>.&nbsp; Oh! one sentence of the scripture did more afflict
and terrify my mind, I mean those sentences that stood against me
(as sometimes I thought they every one did) more, I say, than an
army of forty thousand men that might have come against me.&nbsp;
Woe be to him against whom the scriptures bend themselves!</p>
<p><a href="#l247" id="l247">247</a>.&nbsp; By this temptation I was made to see more into the
nature of the promises than ever I was before; for I lying now
trembling under the mighty hand of God, continually torn and rent
by the thundering of His justice: this made me with careful
heart, and watchful eye, with great fearfulness to turn over
every leaf, and with much diligence, mixed with trembling, to
consider every sentence, together with its natural force and
latitude.</p>
<p><a href="#l248" id="l248">248</a>.&nbsp; By this temptation also I was greatly holden off
from my former foolish practice of putting by the word of promise
when saw it came into my mind; for now, though I could not suck
that comfort and sweetness from the promise, as I had done at
other times; yet, like to a man sinking, I would catch at all I
saw: formerly I thought I might not meddle with the promise,
unless I felt its comfort, but now &rsquo;twas no time thus to
do; the avenger of blood too hardly did pursue me.</p>
<p><a href="#l249" id="l249">249</a>.&nbsp; Now therefore I was glad to catch at <i>that</i>
word which yet I feared I had no ground or right to own; and even
to leap into the bosom of that promise that yet I feared did shut
its heart against me.&nbsp; Now also I should labour to take the
word as God hath laid it down, without restraining the natural
force of one syllable thereof: O! what did I now see in that
blessed sixth of John: <i>And him that cometh to me</i>, <i>I
will in no wise cast out</i>.&nbsp; John vi. 37.&nbsp; Now I
began to consider with myself, that God hath a bigger mouth to
speak with, than I had a heart to conceive with; I thought also
with myself, that He spake not His words in haste, or in an
unadvised heat, but with infinite wisdom and judgment, and in
very truth and faithfulness.&nbsp; 2 Sam. iii. 28.</p>
<p><a href="#l250" id="l250">250</a>.&nbsp; I should in these days, often in my greatest
agonies, even flounce towards the promise (as the horses do
towards sound ground, that yet stick in the mire); concluding
(though as one almost bereft of his wits through fear) on this I
will rest and stay, and leave the fulfilling of it to the God of
heaven that made it.&nbsp; Oh! many a pull hath my heart had with
Satan, for that blessed sixth of John: I did not now, as at other
times, look principally for comfort (though, O how welcome would
it have been unto me!).&nbsp; But now a word, a word to lean a
weary soul upon, that it might not sink for ever! &rsquo;twas
that I hunted for.</p>
<p><a href="#l251" id="l251">251</a>.&nbsp; Yea, often when I have been making to the promise,
I have seen as if the Lord would refuse my soul for ever; I was
often as if I had run upon the pikes, and as if the Lord had
thrust at me, to keep me from Him, as with a flaming sword.&nbsp;
Then I should think of <i>Esther</i>, who went to petition the
king contrary to the law.&nbsp; Esther iv. 16.&nbsp; I thought
also of Benhadad&rsquo;s servants, who went with ropes upon their
heads to their enemies for mercy.&nbsp; 1 Kings xx. 31,
etc.&nbsp; The woman of Canaan also, that would not be daunted,
though called dog by Christ, Matt. xv., 22, etc., and the man
that went to borrow bread at midnight, Luke xi. 5&ndash;8, etc.,
were great encouragements unto me.</p>
<p><a href="#l252" id="l252">252</a>.&nbsp; I never saw those heights and depths in grace, and
love, and mercy, as I saw after this temptation; great sins to
draw out great grace; and where guilt is most terrible and
fierce, there the mercy of God in Christ, when showed to the
soul, appears most high and mighty.&nbsp; When <i>Job</i> had
passed through his captivity, <i>he had twice as much as he had
before</i>.&nbsp; Job xlii. 10.&nbsp; Blessed be God for Jesus
Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Many other things I might here make
observation of, but I would be brief, and therefore shall at this
time omit them; and do pray God that my harms may make others
fear to offend, lest they also be made to bear the iron yoke as I
did.</p>
<p>I had two or three times, at or about my deliverance from this
temptation, such strange apprehensions of the grace of God, that
I could hardly bear up under it: it was so out of measure
amazing, when I thought it could reach me, that I do think if
that sense of it had abode long upon me, it would have made me
incapable for business.</p>
<p><a href="#l253" id="l253">253</a>.&nbsp; Now I shall go forward to give you a relation of
other of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with me at sundry other
seasons, and of the temptations I then did meet withal.&nbsp; I
shall begin with what I met with when first I did join in
fellowship with the people of God in <i>Bedford</i>.&nbsp; After
I had propounded to the church, that my desire was to walk in the
order and ordinances of Christ with them, and was also admitted
by them: while I thought of that blessed ordinance of Christ,
which was His last supper with His disciples before His death,
that scripture, <i>Do this in remembrance of Me</i>, Luke xxii.
19, was made a very precious word unto me; for by it the Lord did
come down upon my conscience with the discovery of His death for
my sins; and as I then felt, did as if He plunged me in the
virtue of the same.&nbsp; But behold, I had not been long a
partaker at that ordinance, but such fierce and sad temptations
did attend me at all times therein, both to blaspheme the
ordinance, and to wish some deadly thing to those that then did
eat thereof: that lest I should at any time be guilty of
consenting to these wicked and fearful thoughts, I was forced to
bend myself all the while, to pray to God to keep me from such
blasphemies: and also to cry to God to bless the bread and cup to
them, as it went from mouth to mouth.&nbsp; The reason of this
temptation, I have thought since, was, because I did not with
that reverence that became me at first, approach to partake
thereof.</p>
<p><a href="#l254" id="l254">254</a>.&nbsp; Thus I continued for three quarters of a year, and
could never have rest nor ease: but at the last the Lord came in
upon my soul with that same scripture, by which my soul was
visited before: and after that, I have been usually very well and
comfortable in the partaking of that blessed ordinance; and have,
I trust, therein discerned the Lord&rsquo;s body, as broken for
my sins, and that His precious blood hath been shed for my
transgressions.</p>
<p><a href="#l255" id="l255">255</a>.&nbsp; Upon a time I was something inclining to a
consumption, wherewith about the spring I was suddenly and
violently seized, with much weakness in my outward man; insomuch
that I thought I could not live.&nbsp; Now began I afresh to give
myself up to a serious examination after my state and condition
for the future, and of my evidences for that blessed world to
come: for it hath, I bless the name of God, been my usual course,
as always, so especially in the day of affliction, to endeavour
to keep my interest in the life to come, clear before mine
eyes.</p>
<p><a href="#l256" id="l256">256</a>.&nbsp; But I had no sooner began to recall to mind my
former experience of the goodness of God to my soul, but there
came flocking into my mind an innumerable company of my sins and
transgressions; amongst which these were at this time most to my
affliction; namely, my deadness, dulness, and coldness in holy
duties; my wanderings of heart, of my wearisomeness in all good
things, my want of love to God, His ways and people, with this at
the end of all, <i>Are these the fruits of
Christianity</i>?&nbsp; <i>Are these tokens of a blessed
man</i>?</p>
<p><a href="#l257" id="l257">257</a>.&nbsp; At the apprehensions of these things my sickness
was doubled upon me; for now I was sick in my inward man, my soul
was clogged with guilt; now also was my former experience of
God&rsquo;s goodness to me, quite taken out of my mind, and hid
as if they had never been, or seen: now was my soul greatly
pinched between these two considerations, <i>Live I must not</i>,
<i>die I dare not</i>.&nbsp; Now I sunk and fell in my spirit,
and was giving up all for lost; but as I was walking up and down
in the house as a man in a most woeful state, that word of God
took hold of my heart, <i>Ye are justified freely by His
grace</i>, <i>through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus</i>.&nbsp; Rom. iii. 24.&nbsp; But oh! what a turn it made
upon me!</p>
<p><a href="#l258" id="l258">258</a>.&nbsp; Now was I as one awaked out of some troublesome
sleep and dream; and listening to this heavenly sentence, I was
as if I had heard it thus expounded to me: <i>Sinner</i>, <i>thou
thinkest</i>, <i>that because thy sins and infirmities</i>, <i>I
cannot save thy soul</i>; <i>but behold My Son is by me</i>,
<i>and upon Him I look</i>, <i>and not on thee</i>, <i>and shall
deal with thee according as I am pleased with Him</i>.&nbsp; At
this I was greatly lightened in my mind, and made to understand,
that God could justify a sinner at any time; it was but His
looking upon Christ, and imputing His benefits to us, and the
work was forthwith done.</p>
<p><a href="#l259" id="l259">259</a>.&nbsp; And as I was thus in a muse, that scripture also
came with great power upon my spirit, <i>Not by works of
righteousness that we have done</i>, <i>but according to His
mercy He hath saved us</i>, <i>etc.</i>&nbsp; 2 Tim. i. 9; Tit.
iii. 5.&nbsp; Now was I got on high, I saw myself within the arms
of grace and mercy; and though I was before afraid to think of a
dying hour, yet, now I cried, <i>Let me die</i>: Now death was
lovely and beautiful in my sight, for I saw <i>We shall never
live indeed</i>, <i>till we be gone to the other world</i>.&nbsp;
Oh! methought this life is but a slumber, in comparison with that
above.&nbsp; At this time also I saw more in these words,
<i>Heirs of God</i>, Rom. viii. 17, than ever I shall be able to
express while I live in this world: <i>Heirs of God</i>!&nbsp;
God Himself is the portion of the saints.&nbsp; This I saw and
wondered at, but cannot tell you what I saw.</p>
<p><a href="#l260" id="l260">260</a>.&nbsp; Again, as I was at another time very ill and weak,
all that time also the tempter did beset me strongly (for I find
he is much for assaulting the soul; when it begins to approach
towards the grave, then is his opportunity), labouring to hide
from me my former experience of God&rsquo;s goodness: also
setting before me the terrors of death, and the judgment of God,
insomuch that at this time, through my fear of miscarrying for
ever (should I now die), I was as one dead before death came, and
was as if I had felt myself already descending into the pit;
methought I said, There were no way, but to hell I must: but
behold, just as I was in the midst of those fears, these words of
the angel&rsquo;s carrying <i>Lazarus</i> into
<i>Abraham&rsquo;s</i> bosom darted in upon me, as who should
say, <i>So it shall be with thee when thou dost leave this
world</i>.&nbsp; This did sweetly revive my spirit, and help me
to hope in God; which when I had with comfort mused on a while,
that word fell with great weight upon my mind, <i>O death</i>,
<i>where is thy sting</i>?&nbsp; <i>O grave</i>, <i>where is thy
victory</i>?&nbsp; 1 Cor. xv. 55.&nbsp; At this I became both
well in body and mind at once, for my sickness did presently
vanish, and I walked comfortably in my work for God again.</p>
<p><a href="#l261" id="l261">261</a>.&nbsp; At another time, though just before I was pretty
well and savoury in my spirit, yet suddenly there fell upon me a
great cloud of darkness, which did so hide from me the things of
God and Christ, that I was as if I had never seen or known them
in my life: I was also so over-run in my soul with a senseless
heartless frame of spirit, that I could not feel my soul to move
or stir after <i>grace</i> and <i>life</i> by <i>Christ</i>; I
was as if my loins were broken, or as if my hands and feet had
been tied or bound with chains.&nbsp; At this time also I felt
some weakness to seize upon my outward man, which made still the
other affliction the more heavy and uncomfortable to me.</p>
<p><a href="#l262" id="l262">262</a>.&nbsp; After I had been in this condition some three or
four days, as I was sitting by the fire, I suddenly felt this
word to sound in my heart, <i>I must go to Jesus</i>.&nbsp; At
this my former darkness and atheism fled away, and the blessed
things of heaven were set in my view.&nbsp; While I was on this
sudden thus overtaken with surprise, Wife (said I), is there ever
such a scripture, <i>I must go to Jesus</i>?&nbsp; She said, she
could not tell; therefore I sat musing still, to see if I could
remember such a place: I had not sat above two or three minutes,
but that came bolting in upon me, <i>And to an innumerable
company of angels</i>; and withal, Hebrews twelfth, about the
mount <i>Sion</i>, was set before mine eyes.&nbsp; Heb. xii.
22&ndash;24.</p>
<p><a href="#l263" id="l263">263</a>.&nbsp; Then with joy I told my wife, <i>O</i>! <i>now I
know</i>, <i>I know</i>!&nbsp; But that night was a good night to
me, I never had but few better; I longed for the company of some
of God&rsquo;s people, that I might have imparted unto them what
God had showed me.&nbsp; Christ was a precious Christ to my soul
that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy, and peace, and
triumph, through Christ.&nbsp; This great glory did not continue
upon me until morning, yet the twelfth of the Author to the
Hebrews, Heb. xii. 22, 23, was a blessed scripture to me for many
days together after this.</p>

Sion</i>, <i>and unto the city of the living God</i>, <i>the
heavenly Jerusalem</i>, <i>and to an innumerable company of
angels</i>, <i>to the general assembly and church of the
first-born</i>, <i>which are written in heaven</i>; <i>and to God
the Judge of all</i>, <i>and to the spirits of just men made
perfect</i>, <i>and to Jesus the Mediator of the New
Covenant</i>, <i>and to the blood of sprinkling</i>, <i>that
speaketh better things than that of Abel</i>.&nbsp; Through this
blessed sentence the Lord led me over and over, first to this
word, and then to that; and showed me wonderful glory in every
one of them.&nbsp; These words also have oft since that time,
been great refreshment to my spirit.&nbsp; Blessed be God for
having mercy on me.</p>
