<p>GRACE ABOUNDING</p>
<p>TO THE CHIEF OF SINNERS</p>
<h3 align="center">OR, A BRIEF RELATION OF THE EXCEEDING MERCY OF
GOD IN CHRIST, TO HIS POOR SERVANT JOHN BUNYAN</h3>
<p><a id="id1" href="#id1">1</a>. In this my relation of the merciful working of God upon my
soul, it will not be amiss, if, in the first place, I do, in a few
words, give you a hint of my pedigree, and manner of bringing up;
that thereby the goodness and bounty of God towards me, may be the
more advanced and magnified before the sons of men.</p>
<p><a id="id2" href="#id2">2</a>. For my descent then, it was, as is well known by many, of a
low and inconsiderable generation; my father's house being of that
rank that is meanest and most despised of all the families in the
land. Wherefore I have not here, as others, to boast of noble
blood, or of a high-born state, according to the flesh; though, all
things considered, I magnify the heavenly Majesty, for that by this
door He brought me into this world, to partake of the grace and
life that is in Christ by the gospel.</p>
<p><a id="id3" href="#id3">3</a>. But yet, notwithstanding the meanness and inconsiderableness
of my parents, it pleased God to put it into their hearts to put me
to school, to learn both to read and write; the which I also
attained, according to the rate of other poor men's children;
though, to my shame I confess, I did soon lose that little I
learned, and that even almost utterly, and that long before the
Lord did work His gracious work of conversion upon my soul.</p>
<p><a id="id4" href="#id4">4</a>. As for my own natural life, for the time that I was without
God in the world, it was indeed according to the course of this
world, and 'the spirit that now worketh in the children of
disobedience' (Eph. 2.2, 3). It was my delight to be 'taken captive
by the devil at his will' (II Tim. 2.26). Being filled with all
unrighteousness, the which did also so strongly work and put forth
itself, both in my heart and life, and that from a child, that I
had but few equals, especially considering my years, which were
tender, being few, both for cursing, swearing, lying, and
blaspheming the holy name of God.</p>
<p><a id="id5" href="#id5">5</a>. Yea, so settled and rooted was I in these things, that they
became as a second nature to me; the which, as I also have with
soberness considered since, did so offend the Lord, that even in my
childhood He did scare and affright me with fearful dreams, and did
terrify me with dreadful visions; for often, after I had spent this
and the other day in sin, I have in my bed been greatly afflicted,
while asleep, with the apprehensions of devils and wicked spirits,
who still, as I then thought, laboured to draw me away with them,
of which I could never be rid.</p>
<p><a id="id6" href="#id6">6</a>. Also I should, at these years, be greatly afflicted and
troubled with the thoughts of the day of judgment, and that both
night and day, and should tremble at the thoughts of the fearful
torments of hell fire; still fearing that it would be my lot to be
found at last amongst those devils and hellish fiends, who are
there bound down with the chains and bonds of eternal darkness,
'unto the judgment of the great day.'</p>
<p><a id="id7" href="#id7">7</a>. These things, I say, when I was but a child but nine or ten
years old, did so distress my soul, that when in the midst of my
many sports and childish vanities, amidst my vain companions, I was
often much cast down and afflicted in my mind therewith, yet could
I not let go my sins. Yea, I was also then so overcome with despair
of life and heaven, that I should often wish either that there had
been no hell, or that I had been a devil-supposing they were only
tormentors; that if it must needs be that I went thither, I might
be rather a tormentor, than be tormented myself.</p>
<p><a id="id8" href="#id8">8</a>. A while after, these terrible dreams did leave me, which also
I soon forgot; for my pleasures did quickly cut off the remembrance
of them, as if they had never been: wherefore, with more
greediness, according to the strength of nature, I did still let
loose the reins to my lusts, and delighted in all transgression
against the law of God: so that, until I came to the state of
marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the youth that kept me
company, into all manner of vice and ungodliness.</p>
<p><a id="id9" href="#id9">9</a>. Yea, such prevalency had the lusts and fruits of the flesh in
this poor soul of mine, that had not a miracle of precious grace
prevented, I had not only perished by the stroke of eternal
justice, but had also laid myself open, even to the stroke of those
laws, which bring some to disgrace and open shame before the face
of the world.</p>
<p><a id="id10" href="#id10">10</a>. In these days, the thoughts of religion were very grievous
to me; I could neither endure it myself, nor that any other should;
so that, when I have seen some read in those books that concerned
Christian piety, it would be as it were a prison to me. Then I said
unto God, 'Depart from me, for I desire not the knowledge of thy
ways' (Job 21.14). I was now void of all good consideration, heaven
and hell were both out of sight and mind; and as for saving and
damning, they were least in my thoughts. O Lord, thou knowest my
life, and my ways were not hid from Thee.</p>
<p><a id="id11" href="#id11">11</a>. Yet this I well remember, that though I could myself sin
with the greatest delight and ease, and also take pleasure in the
vileness of my companions; yet, even then, if I have at any time
seen wicked things, by those who professed goodness, it would make
my spirit tremble. As once, above all the rest, when I was in my
height of vanity, yet hearing one to swear that was reckoned for a
religious man, it had so great a stroke upon my spirit, that it
made my heart to ache.</p>
<p><a id="id12" href="#id12">12</a>. But God did not utterly leave me, but followed me still, not
now with convictions, but judgments; yet, such as were mixed with
mercy. For once I fell into a creek of the sea, and hardly escaped
drowning. Another time I fell out of a boat into Bedford river, but
mercy yet preserved me alive. Besides, another time, being in the
field with one of my companions, it chanced that an adder passed
over the highway; so I, having a stick in my hand, struck her over
the back; and having stunned her, I forced open her mouth with my
stick, and plucked her sting out with my fingers, by which act, had
not God been merciful, I might, by my desperateness, have brought
myself to mine end.</p>
<p><a id="id13" href="#id13">13</a>. This also have I taken notice of with thanksgiving; when I
was a soldier, I, with others, were drawn out to go to such a place
to besiege it; but when I was just ready to go, one of the company
desired to go in my room; to which, when I had consented, he took
my place; and coming to the siege, as he stood sentinel, he was
shot into the head with a musket bullet, and died.</p>
<p><a id="id14" href="#id14">14</a>. Here, as I said, were judgments and mercy, but neither of
them did awaken my soul to righteousness; wherefore I sinned still,
and grew more and more rebellious against God, and careless of mine
own salvation.</p>
<p><a id="id15" href="#id15">15</a>. Presently after this, I changed my condition into a married
state, and my mercy was to light upon a wife whose father was
counted godly. This woman and I, though we came together as poor as
poor might be, not having so much household stuff as a dish or
spoon betwixt us both, yet this she had for her part, The Plain
Man's Pathway to Heaven, and The Practice of Piety, which her
father had left her when he died. In these two books I should
sometimes read with her, wherein I also found some things that were
somewhat pleasing to me; but all this while I met with no
conviction. She also would be often telling of me, what a godly man
her father was, and how he would reprove and correct vice, both in
his house, and amongst his neighbours; what a strict and holy life
he lived in his day, both in word and deed.</p>
<p><a id="id16" href="#id16">16</a>. Wherefore these books with this relation, though they did
not reach my heart, to awaken it about my sad and sinful state, yet
they did beget within me some desires to religion: so that, because
I knew no better, I fell in very eagerly with the religion of the
times; to wit, to go to church twice a day, and that too with the
foremost; and there should very devoutly, both say and sing as
others did, yet retaining my wicked life; but withal, I was so
overrun with a spirit of superstition, that I adored, and that with
great devotion, even all things, both the high place, priest,
clerk, vestment, service, and what else belonging to the church;
counting all things holy that were therein contained, and
especially the priest and clerk most happy, and without doubt,
greatly blessed, because they were the servants, as I then thought,
of God, and were principal in the holy temple, to do His work
therein.</p>
<p><a id="id17" href="#id17">17</a>. This conceit grew so strong in little time upon my spirit,
that had I but seen a priest, though never so sordid and debauched
in his life, I should find my spirit fall under him, reverence him,
and knit unto him: yea, I thought for the love I did bear unto
them, supposing they were the ministers of God, I could have lain
down at their feet, and have been trampled upon by them; their
name, their garb, and work, did so intoxicate and bewitch me.</p>
<p><a id="id18" href="#id18">18</a>. After I had been thus for some considerable time, another
thought came into my mind; and that was, whether we were of the
Israelites, or no? For finding in the Scriptures that they were
once the peculiar people of God, thought I, if I were one of this
race, my soul must needs be happy. Now again, I found within me a
great longing to be resolved about this question, but could not
tell how I should. At last I asked my father of it; who told me,
No, we were not. Wherefore then I fell in my spirit as to the hopes
of that, and so remained.</p>
<p><a id="id19" href="#id19">19</a>. But all this while, I was not sensible of the danger and
evil of sin; I was kept from considering that sin would damn me,
what religion soever I followed, unless I was found in Christ. Nay,
I never thought of Him, nor whether there was one, or no. Thus man,
while blind, doth wander, but wearieth himself with vanity, for he
knoweth not the way to the city of God (Eccl. 10.15).</p>
<p><a id="id20" href="#id20">20</a>. But one day, amongst all the sermons our parson made, his
subject was, to treat of the Sabbath-day, and of the evil of
breaking that, either with labour, sports or otherwise. Now I was,
notwithstanding my religion, one that took much delight in all
manner of vice, and especially that was the day that I did solace
myself therewith, wherefore I fell in my conscience under his
sermon, thinking and believing that he made that sermon on purpose
to show me my evil doing; and at that time I felt what guilt was,
though never before, that I can remember; but then I was, for the
present, greatly loaden therewith, and so went home when the sermon
was ended, with a great burden upon my spirit.</p>
<p><a id="id21" href="#id21">21</a>. This, for that instant, did benumb the sinews of my best
delights, and did imbitter my former pleasures to me; but behold,
it lasted not, for before I had well dined, the trouble began to go
off my mind, and my heart returned to his old course: but oh! how
glad was I, that this trouble was gone from me, and that the fire
was put out, that I might sin again without control! Wherefore,
when I had satisfied nature with my food, I shook the sermon out of
my mind, and to my old custom of sports and gaming I returned with
great delight.</p>
<p><a id="id22" href="#id22">22</a>. But the same day, as I was in the midst of a game at cat,
and having struck it one blow from the hole, just as I was about to
strike it the second time, a voice did suddenly dart from heaven
into my soul, which said, Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to
heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell? At this I was put to an
exceeding maze; wherefore, leaving my cat upon the ground, I looked
up to heaven, and was as if I had, with the eyes of my
understanding, seen the Lord Jesus looking down upon me, as being
very hotly displeased with me, and as if He did severely threaten
me with some grievous punishment for these and other my ungodly
practices.</p>
<p><a id="id23" href="#id23">23</a>. I had no sooner thus conceived in my mind, but suddenly this
conclusion was fastened on my spirit, for the former hint did set
my sins again before my face, that I had been a great and grievous
sinner, and that it was now too late for me to look after heaven;
for Christ would not forgive me, nor pardon my transgressions. Then
I fell to musing upon this also; and while I was thinking on it,
and fearing lest it should be so, I felt my heart sink in despair,
concluding it was too late; and therefore I resolved in my mind I
would go on in sin; for, thought I, if the case be thus, my state
is surely miserable; miserable if I leave my sins, and but
miserable if I follow then; I can but be damned, and if I must be
so, I had as good be damned for many sins, as to be damned for
few.</p>
<p><a id="id24" href="#id24">24</a>. Thus I stood in the midst of my play, before all that then
were present; but yet I told them nothing: but I say, I having made
this conclusion, I returned desperately to my sport again; and I
well remember, that presently this kind of despair did so possess
my soul, that I was persuaded I could never attain to other comfort
than what I should get in sin; for heaven was gone already, so that
on that I must not think; wherefore I found within me a great
desire to take my fill of sin, still studying what sin was set to
be committed, that I might taste the sweetness of it; and I made as
much haste as I could to fill my belly with its delicates, lest I
should die before I had my desire; for that I feared greatly. In
these things, I protest before God, I lie not, neither do I feign
this sort of speech; these were really, strongly, and with all my
heart, my desires; the good Lord, whose mercy is unsearchable,
forgive me my transgressions .</p>
<p><a id="id25" href="#id25">25</a>. And I am very confident, that this temptation of the devil
is more than usual amongst poor creatures than many are aware of,
even to overrun their spirits with a scurvy and seared frame of
heart, and benumbing of conscience; which frame, he stilly and
slily supplieth with such despair, that though not much guilt
attendeth the soul, yet they continually have a secret conclusion
within them, that there is no hopes for them; for they have loved
sons, 'therefore after them they will go' (Jer. 2.25; 18.12).</p>
<p><a id="id26" href="#id26">26</a>. Now therefore I went on in sin with great greediness of
mind, still grudging that I could not be so satisfied with it as I
would. This did continue with me about a month, or more; but one
day, as I was standing at a neighbour's shop-window, and there
cursing and swearing, and playing the madman, after my wonted
manner, there sat within the woman of the house, and heard me, who,
though she was a very loose and ungodly wretch, yet protested that
I swore and cursed at that most fearful rate, that she was made to
tremble to hear me; and told me further, That I was the ungodliest
fellow for swearing that ever she heard in all her life; and that
I, by thus doing, was able to spoil all the youth in a whole town,
if they came but in my company.</p>
<p><a id="id27" href="#id27">27</a>. At this reproof I was silenced, and put to secret shame, and
that too, as I thought, before the God of heaven; wherefore, while
I stood there, and hanging down my head. I wished with all my heart
that I might be a little child again, that my father might learn me
to speak without this wicked way of swearing; for, thought I, I am
so accustomed to it, that it is in vain for me to think of a
reformation, for I thought it could never be.</p>
<p><a id="id28" href="#id28">28</a>. But how it came to pass, I know not; I did from this time
forward so leave my swearing, that it was a great wonder to myself
to observe it; and whereas before, I knew not how to speak unless I
put an oath before, and another behind, to make my words have
authority; now, I could, without it, speak better, and with more
pleasantness, than ever I could before. All this while I knew not
Jesus Christ, neither did I leave my sports and plays.</p>
<p><a id="id29" href="#id29">29</a>. But quickly after this, I fell in company with one poor man
that made profession of religion; who, as I then thought, did talk
pleasantly of the Scriptures, and of the matters of religion;
wherefore, falling into some love and liking to what he said, I
betook me to my Bible, and began to take great pleasure in reading,
but especially with the historical part thereof; for, as for Paul's
epistles, and Scriptures of that nature, I could not away with
them, being as yet but ignorant, either of the corruptions of my
nature, or of the want and worth of Jesus Christ to save me.</p>
<p><a id="id30" href="#id30">30</a>. Wherefore I fell to some outward reformation, both in my
words and life, and did set the commandments before me for my way
to heaven; which commandments I also did strive to keep, and, as I
thought, did keep them pretty well sometimes, and then I should
have comfort; yet now and then should break one, and so afflict my
conscience; but then I should repent, and say I was sorry for it,
and promise God to do better next time, and there get help again,
for then I thought I pleased God as well as any man in England.</p>
<p><a id="id31" href="#id31">31</a>. Thus I continued about a year; all which time our neighbours
did take me to be a very godly man, a new and religious man, and
did marvel much to see such a great and famous alteration in my
life and manners; and, indeed, so it was, though yet I knew not
Christ, nor grace, nor faith, nor hope; and truly, as I have well
seen since, had I then died, my state had been most fearful; well,
this, I say, continued about a twelvemonth or more.</p>
<p><a id="id32" href="#id32">32</a>. But, I say, my neighbours were amazed at this my great
conversion, from prodigious profaneness, to something like a moral
life; and, truly, so they well might; for this my conversion was as
great, as for Tom of Bedlam to become a sober man. Now, therefore,
they began to praise, to commend, and to speak well of me, both to
my face, and behind my back. Now, I was, as they said, become
godly; now, I was become a right honest man. But oh! when I
understood that these were their words and opinions of me, it
pleased me mighty well. For though, as yet, I was nothing but a
poor painted hypocrite, yet I loved to be talked of as one that was
truly godly. I was proud of my godliness, and, I did all I did,
either to be seen of, or to be well spoken of, by man. And thus I
continued for about a twelvemonth or more.</p>
<p><a id="id33" href="#id33">33</a>. Now you must know, that before this I had taken much delight
in ringing, but my conscience beginning to be tender, I thought
such practice was but vain, and therefore forced myself to leave
it, yet my mind hankered; wherefore I should go to the steeple
house, and look on it, though I durst not ring. But I thought this
did not become religion neither, yet I forced myself, and would
look on still; but quickly after, I began to think, How, if one of
the bells should fall? Then I chose to stand under a main beam,
that lay overthwart the steeple, from side to side, thinking there
I might stand sure, but then I should think again, should the bell
fall with a swing, it might first hit the wall, and then rebounding
upon me, might kill me for all this beam. This made me stand in the
steeple door; and now, thought I, I am safe enough; for if a bell
should then fall, I can slip out behind these thick walls, and so
be preserved notwithstanding.</p>
<p><a id="id34" href="#id34">34</a>. So, after this, I would yet go to see them ring, but would
not go farther than the steeple door; but then it came into my
head, How, if the steeple itself should fall? And this thought, it
may fall for aught I know, when I stood and looked on, did
continually so shake my mind, that I durst not stand at the steeple
door any longer, but was forced to flee, for fear the steeple
should fall upon my head.</p>
<p><a id="id35" href="#id35">35</a>. Another thing was my dancing; I was a full year before I
could quite leave that; but all this while, when I thought I kept
this or that commandment, or did, by word or deed, anything that I
thought was good, I had great peace in my conscience; and should
think with myself, God cannot choose but be now pleased with me;
yea, to relate it in mine own way, I thought no man in England
could please God better than I.</p>
<p><a id="id36" href="#id36">36</a>. But, poor wretch as I was, I was all this while ignorant of
Jesus Christ, and going about to establish my own righteousness;
and had perished therein, had not God, in mercy, showed me more of
my state of nature.</p>
<p><a id="id37" href="#id37">37</a>. But upon a day, the good providence of God did cast me to
Bedford, to work on my calling; and in one of the streets of that
town, I came where there were three or four poor women sitting at a
door in the sun, and talking about the things of God; and being now
willing to hear them discourse, I drew near to hear what they said,
for I was now a brisk talker also myself in the matters of
religion, but now I may say, I heard, but I understood not; for
they were far above, out of my reach, for their talk was about a
new birth, the work of God on their hearts, also how they were
convinced of their miserable state by nature; they talked how God
had visited their souls with His love in the Lord Jesus, and with
what words and promises they had been refreshed, comforted, and
supported against the temptations of the devil. Moreover, they
reasoned of the suggestions and temptations of Satan in particular;
and told to each other by which they had been afflicted, and how
they were borne up under his assaults. They also discoursed of
their own wretchedness of heart, of their unbelief; and did
contemn, slight, and abhor their own righteousness, as filthy and
insufficient to do them any good.</p>
<p><a id="id38" href="#id38">38</a>. And methought they spake as if joy did make them speak; they
spake with such pleasantness of Scripture language, and with such
appearance of grace in all they said, that they were to me as if
they had found a new world, as if they were people that dwelt
alone, and were not to be reckoned among their neighbours (Num.
23.9).</p>
<p><a id="id39" href="#id39">39</a>. At this I felt my own heart began to shake, as mistrusting
my condition to be naught; for I saw that in all my thoughts about
religion and salvation, the new birth did never enter into my mind,
neither knew I the comfort of the Word and promise, nor the
deceitfulness and treachery of my own wicked heart. As for secret
thoughts, I took no notice of them; neither did I understand what
Satan's temptations were, nor how they were to be withstood and
resisted, etc.</p>
<p><a id="id40" href="#id40">40</a>. Thus, therefore, when I had heard and considered what they
said, I left them, and went about my employment again, but their
talk and discourse went with me; also my heart would tarry with
them, for I was greatly affected with their words, both because by
them I was convinced that I wanted the true tokens of a truly godly
man, and also because by them I was convinced of the happy and
blessed condition of him that was such a one.</p>
<p><a id="id41" href="#id41">41</a>. Therefore I should often make it my business to be going
again and again into the company of these poor people, for I could
not stay away; and the more I went amongst them, the more I did
question my condition; and as I still do remember, presently I
found two things within me, at which I did sometimes marvel,
especially considering what a blind, ignorant, sordid, and ungodly
wretch but just before I was; the one was a great softness and
tenderness of heart, which caused me to fall under the conviction
of what by Scripture they asserted; and the other was a great
bending in my mind to a continual meditating on it, and on all
other good things which at any time I heard or read of.</p>
<p><a id="id42" href="#id42">42</a>. By these things my mind was now so turned, that it lay like
a horse leech at the vein, still crying out, Give, give (Prov.
30.15); yea, it was so fixed on eternity, and on the things about
the kingdom of heaven, that is, so far as I knew, though as yet,
God knows, I knew but little; that neither pleasures nor profits,
nor persuasions, nor threats, could loosen it, or make it let go
his hold; and though I may speak it with shame, yet it is in very
deed a certain truth, it would then have been as difficult for me
to have taken my mind from heaven to earth, as I have found it
often since to get it again from earth to heaven.</p>
<p><a id="id43" href="#id43">43</a>. One thing I may not omit: There was a young man in our town,
to whom my heart was knit more than to any other, but he being a
most wicked creature for cursing, and swearing, and whoring, I now
shook him off, and forsook his company: but about a quarter of a
year after I had left him, I met him in a certain lane, and asked
him how he did; he, after his old swearing and mad way, answered,
he was well. But, Harry, said I, why do you swear and curse thus?
What will become of you, if you die in this condition? He answered
me in a great chafe, What would the devil do for company, if it
were not for such as I am?</p>
<p><a id="id44" href="#id44">44</a>. About this time I met with some Ranters' books, that were
put forth by some of our countrymen, which books were also highly
in esteem by several old professors; some of these I read, but was
not able to make a judgment about them; wherefore as I read in
them, and thought upon them, feeling myself unable to judge, I
should betake myself to hearty prayer in this manner: O Lord, I am
a fool, and not able to know the truth from error: Lord, leave me
not to my own blindness, either to approve of, or condemn this
doctrine; if it be of God, let me not despise it; if it be of the
devil, let me not embrace it. Lord, I lay my soul, in this matter,
only at Thy foot; let me not be deceived, I humbly beseech Thee. I
had one religious intimate companion all this while, and that was
the poor man that I spoke of before; but about this time he also
turned a most devilish Ranter, and gave himself up to all manner of
filthiness, especially uncleanness; he would also deny that there
was a God, angel, or spirit; and would laugh at all exhortations to
sobriety. When I laboured to rebuke his wickedness, he would laugh
the more, and pretend that he had gone through all religions, and
could never light on the right till now. He told me also, that in a
little time we should see all professors turn to the ways of the
Ranters. Wherefore, abominating those cursed principles, I left his
company forthwith, and became to him as great a stranger, as I had
been before a familiar.</p>
<p><a id="id45" href="#id45">45</a>. Neither was this man only a temptation to me; but my calling
lying in the country, I happened to light into several people's
company, who, though strict in religion formerly, yet were also
swept away by these Ranters. These would also talk with me of their
ways, and condemn me as legal and dark; pretending that they had
only attained to perfection that could do what they would, and not
sin. Oh! these temptations were suitable to my flesh, I being but a
young man, and my nature in its prime; but God, who had, I hope,
designed me for better things, kept me in the fear of His name, and
did not suffer me to accept of such principles. And blessed be God,
who put it into my heart to cry to Him to be kept and directed,
still distrusting mine own wisdom; for I have since seen even the
effect of that prayer, in His preserving me not only from ranting
errors, but from those also that have sprung up since. The Bible
was precious to me in those days.</p>
<p><a id="id46" href="#id46">46</a>. And now, methought, I began to look into the Bible with new
eyes, and read as I never did before; and especially the epistles
of the apostle Paul were sweet and pleasant to me; and, indeed, I
was then never out of the Bible, either by reading or meditation;
still crying out to God, that I might know the truth, and way to
heaven and glory.</p>
<p><a id="id47" href="#id47">47</a>. And as I went on and read, I lighted on that passage, 'To
one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word
of knowledge by the same Spirit; and to another faith,' etc. (1
Cor. 12.8, 9). And though, as I have since seen, that by this
Scripture the Holy Ghost intends, in special, things extraordinary,
yet on me it did then fasten with conviction, that I did want
things ordinary, even that understanding and wisdom that other
Christians had. On this word I mused, and could not tell what to
do, especially this word faith put me to it, for I could not help
it, but sometimes must question, whether I had any faith or no; for
I feared that it shut me out of all the blessings that other good
people had given them of God; but I was loath to conclude I had no
faith in my soul; for if I do so, thought I, then I shall count
myself a very castaway indeed.</p>
<p><a id="id48" href="#id48">48</a>. No, said I with myself, though I am convinced that I am an
ignorant sot, and that I want those blessed gifts of knowledge and
understanding that other good people have; yet, at a venture, I
will conclude I am not altogether faithless, though I know not what
faith is. For it was showed me, and that too, as I have since seen,
by Satan, that those who conclude themselves in a faithless state,
have neither rest nor quiet in their souls; and I was loath to fall
quite into despair.</p>
<p><a id="id49" href="#id49">49</a>. Wherefore, by this suggestion, I was for a while made afraid
to see my want of faith; but God would not suffer me thus to undo
and destroy my soul, but did continually, against this my blind and
sad conclusion, create still within me such suppositions, insomuch
that I might in this deceive myself, that I could not rest content,
until I did now come to some certain knowledge, whether I had faith
or no; this always running in my mind, But how if you want faith
indeed? But how can you tell if you have faith? And, besides, I saw
for certain, if I had not, I was sure to perish for ever.</p>
<p><a id="id50" href="#id50">50</a>. So that though I endeavoured at the first to look over the
business of faith, yet in a little time, I better considering the
matter, was willing to put myself upon the trial, whether I had
faith or no. But alas, poor wretch, so ignorant and brutish was I,
that I knew to this day no more how to do it, than I know how to
begin and accomplish that rare and curious piece of art which I
never yet saw nor considered.</p>
<p><a id="id51" href="#id51">51</a>. Wherefore, while I was thus considering, and being put to my
plunge about it, for you must know, that as yet I had in this
matter broken my mind to no man, only did hear and consider, the
tempter came in with his delusion, That there was no way for me to
know I had faith, but by trying to work some miracle: urging those
Scriptures that seem to look that way, for the enforcing and
strengthening his temptation. Nay, one day as I was betwixt Elstow
and Bedford, the temptation was hot upon me to try if I had faith,
by doing of some miracle: which miracle at that time was this, I
must say to the puddles that were in the horse pads, Be dry; and to
the dry places, Be you the puddles. And truly, one time I was
a-going to say so indeed; but just as I was about to speak, this
thought came into my mind, But go under yonder hedge and pray
first, that God would make you able. But when I had concluded to
pray, this came hot upon me, That if I prayed, and came again and
tried to do it, and yet did nothing notwithstanding, then be sure I
had no faith, but was a castaway and lost. Nay, thought I, if it be
so, I will never try yet, but will stay a little longer.</p>
<p><a id="id52" href="#id52">52</a>. So I continued at a great loss; for I thought, if they only
had faith, which could do so wonderful things, then I concluded
that, for the present, I neither had it, nor yet, for time to come,
were ever like to have it. Thus I was tossed between the devil and
my own ignorance, and so perplexed, especially at some times, that
I could not tell what to do.</p>
<p><a id="id53" href="#id53">53</a>. About this time, the state and happiness of these poor
people at Bedford was thus, in a dream or vision, represented to
me. I saw, as if they were set on the sunny side of some high
mountain, there refreshing themselves with the pleasant beams of
the sun, while I was shivering and shrinking in the cold, afflicted
with frost, snow, and dark clouds. Methought, also, betwixt me and
them, I saw a wall that did compass about this mountain; now,
through this wall my soul did greatly desire to pass; concluding,
that if I could, I would go even into the very midst of them, and
there also comfort myself with the heat of their sun.</p>
<p><a id="id54" href="#id54">54</a>. About this wall I thought myself, to go again and again,
still prying as I went, to see if I could find some way or passage,
by which I might enter therein; but none could I find for some
time. At the last, I saw, as it were, a narrow gap, like a little
doorway in the wall, through which I attempted to pass; but the
passage being very strait and narrow, I made many efforts to get
in, but all in vain, even until I was well-nigh quite beat out, by
striving to get in; at last, with great striving, methought I at
first did get in my head, and after that, by a sidling striving, my
shoulders, and my whole body; then I was exceeding glad, and went
and sat down in the midst of them, and so was comforted with the
light and heat of their sun.</p>
<p><a id="id55" href="#id55">55</a>. Now, this mountain and wall, etc., was thus made out to
me-the mountain signified the church of the living God; the sun
that shone thereon, the comfortable shining of His merciful face on
them that were therein; the wall, I thought, was the Word, that did
make separation between the Christians and the world; and the gap
which was in this wall, I thought, was Jesus Christ, who is the way
to God the Father (John 14.6; Matt. 7.14). But forasmuch as the
passage was wonderful narrow, even so narrow, that I could not, but
with great difficulty, enter in thereat, it showed me that none
could enter into life, but those that were in downright earnest,
and unless they left this wicked world behind them; for here was
only room for body and soul, but not for body and soul, and
sin.</p>
<p><a id="id56" href="#id56">56</a>. This resemblance abode upon my spirit many days; all which
time I saw myself in a forlorn and sad condition, but yet was
provoked to a vehement hunger and desire to be one of that number
that did sit in the sunshine. Now also I should pray wherever I
was, whether at home or abroad, in house or field, and should also
often, with lifting up of heart, sing that of the 51st Psalm, 'O
Lord, consider my distress'; for as yet I knew not where I was.</p>
<p><a id="id57" href="#id57">57</a>. Neither as yet could I attain to any comfortable persuasion
that I had faith in Christ; but instead of having satisfaction,
here I began to find my soul to be assaulted with fresh doubts
about my future happiness; especially with such as these, Whether I
was elected? But how, if the day of grace should now be past and
gone?</p>
<p><a id="id58" href="#id58">58</a>. By these two temptations I was very much afflicted and
disquieted; sometimes by one, and sometimes by the other of them.
And first, to speak of that about my questioning my election, I
found at this time, that though I was in a flame to find the way to
heaven and glory, and though nothing could beat me off from this,
yet this question did so offend and discourage me, that I was,
especially at some times, as if the very strength of my body also
had been taken away by the force and power thereof. This scripture
did also seem to me to trample upon all my desires, 'It is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
mercy' (Rom. 9.16).</p>
<p><a id="id59" href="#id59">59</a>. With this scripture I could not tell what to do; for I
evidently saw, that unless the great God, of His infinite grace and
bounty, had voluntarily chosen me to be a vessel of mercy, though I
should desire, and long and labour until my heart did break, no
good could come of it. Therefore, this would still stick with me,
How can you tell that you are elected? And what if you should not?
How then?</p>
<p><a id="id60" href="#id60">60</a>. 0 Lord, thought I, what if I should not, indeed? It may be
you are not, said the tempter; it may be so, indeed, thought I.
Why, then, said Satan, you had as good leave off, and strive no
further; for if, indeed, you should not be elected and chosen of
God, there is no talk of your being saved; 'For it is neither of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
mercy.'</p>
<p><a id="id61" href="#id61">61</a>. By these things I was driven to my wits' end, not knowing
what to say, or how to answer these temptations. Indeed, I little
thought that Satan had thus assaulted me, but that rather it was my
own prudence, thus to start the question; for, that the elect only
attained eternal life, that I, without scruple, did heartily close
withal; but that myself was one of them, there lay all the
question.</p>
<p><a id="id62" href="#id62">62</a>. Thus, therefore, for several days, I was greatly assaulted
and perplexed, and was often, when I have been walking, ready to
sink where I went, with faintness in my mind; but one day, after I
had been so many weeks oppressed and cast down therewith, as I was
now quite giving up the ghost of all my hopes of ever attaining
life, that sentence fell with weight upon my spirit, 'Look at the
generations of old and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was
confounded?'</p>
<p><a id="id63" href="#id63">63</a>. At which I was greatly lightened and encouraged in my soul;
for thus, at that very instant, it was expounded to me, Begin at
the beginning of Genesis, and read to the end of the Revelations,
and see if you can find that there was ever any that trusted in the
Lord, and was confounded. So, coming home, I presently went to my
Bible to see if I could find that saying, not doubting but to find
it presently; for it was so fresh, and with such strength and
comfort on my spirit, that I was as if it talked with me.</p>
<p><a id="id64" href="#id64">64</a>. Well, I looked, but I found it not; only it abode upon me;
then I did ask first this good man, and then another, if they knew
where it was, but they knew no such place. At this I wondered that
such a sentence should so suddenly, and with such comfort and
strength, seize and abide upon my heart, and yet that none could
find it, for I doubted not but it was in holy Scripture.</p>
<p><a id="id65" href="#id65">65</a>. Thus I continued above a year, and could not find the place;
but at last, casting my eye into the Apocrypha books, I found it in
Ecclesiasticus 2.10. This, at the first, did somewhat daunt me; but
because, by this time, I had got more experience of the love and
kindness of God, it troubled me the less; especially when I
considered, that though it was not in those texts that we call holy
and canonical, yet forasmuch as this sentence was the sum and
substance of many of the promises, it was my duty to take the
comfort of it; and I bless God for that word, for it was of God to
me: that word doth still, at times, shine before my face.</p>
<p><a id="id66" href="#id66">66</a>. After this, that other doubt did come with strength upon me,
But how if the day of grace should be past and gone? How if you
have overstood the time of mercy? Now, I remember that one day, as
I was walking into the country, I was much in the thoughts of this,
But how if the day of grace be past? And to aggravate my trouble,
the tempter presented to my mind those good people of Bedford, and
suggested thus unto me, That these being converted already, they
were all that God would save in those parts; and that I came too
late, for these had got the blessing before I came.</p>
<p><a id="id67" href="#id67">67</a>. Now was I in great distress, thinking in very deed that this
might well be so; wherefore I went up and down bemoaning my sad
condition, counting myself far worse than a thousand fools, for
standing off thus long, and spending so many years in sin as I had
done; still crying out, Oh, that I had turned sooner! Oh, that I
had turned seven years ago! It made me also angry with myself, to
think that I should have no more wit, but to trifle away my time
till my soul and heaven were lost.</p>
<p><a id="id68" href="#id68">68</a>. But when I had been long vexed with this fear, and was
scarce able to take one step more, just about the same place where
I received my other encouragement, these words broke in upon my
mind, 'Compel them to come in, that my house may be filled'; 'and
yet there is room' (Luke 14.22, 23). These words, but especially
them, 'And yet there is room', were sweet words to me; for, truly,
I thought that by them I saw there was place enough in heaven for
me; and, moreover, that when the Lord Jesus did speak these words,
He then did think of me; and that He, knowing that the time would
come that I should be afflicted with fear that there was no place
left for me in His bosom, did before speak this word, and leave it
upon record, that I might find help thereby against this vile
temptation. This, I then verily believed.</p>
<p><a id="id69" href="#id69">69</a>. In the light and encouragement of this word, I went a pretty
while; and the comfort was the more, when I thought that the Lord
Jesus should think on me so long ago, and that He should speak
those words on purpose for my sake; for I did then think, verily,
that He did on purpose speak them, to encourage me withal.</p>
<p><a id="id70" href="#id70">70</a>. But I was not without my temptations to go back again;
temptations, I say, both from Satan, mine own heart, and carnal
acquaintance; but I thank God these were outweighed by that sound
sense of death and of the day of judgment, which abode, as it were,
continually in my view; I should often also think on
Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is said, He had given him all the
kingdoms of the earth (Dan. 5.19). Yet, I thought, if this great
man had all his portion in this world, one hour in hell fire would
make him forget all. Which consideration was a great help to
me.</p>
<p><a id="id71" href="#id71">71</a>. I was almost made, about this time, to see something
concerning the beasts that Moses counted clean and unclean. I
thought those beasts were types of men; the clean, types of them
that were the people of God; but the unclean, types of such as were
the children of the wicked one. Now, I read that the clean beasts
chewed the cud; that is, thought I, they show us we must feed upon
the Word of God. They also parted the hoof; I thought that
signified we must part, if we would be saved, with the ways of
ungodly men. And also, in further reading about them I found that
though we did chew the cud as the hare, yet if we walked with claws
like a dog, or if we did part the hoof like the swine, yet if we
did not chew the cud as the sheep, we were still, for all that, but
unclean; for I thought the hare to be a type of those that talk of
the Word, yet walk in the ways of sin; and that the swine was like
him that parted with his outward pollutions, but still wanteth the
Word of faith, without which there could be no way of salvation,
let a man be never so devout (Deut.14). After this I found, by
reading the Word, that those that must be glorified with Christ in
another world must be called by Him here; called to the partaking
of a share in His Word and righteousness, and to the comforts and
first fruits of His Spirit, and to a peculiar interest in all those
heavenly things which do indeed fore fit the soul for that rest and
house of glory which is in heaven above.</p>
<p><a id="id72" href="#id72">72</a>. Here, again, I was at a very great stand, not knowing what
to do, fearing I was not called; for, thought I, if I be not
called, what then can do me good? None but those who are
effectually called, inherit the kingdom of heaven. But oh! how I
now loved those words that spake of a Christian's calling! as when
the Lord said to one, 'Follow me', and to another, 'Come after me'.
And oh! thought I, that He would say so to me too, how gladly would
I run after him!</p>
<p><a id="id73" href="#id73">73</a>. I cannot now express with what longings and breakings in my
soul I cried to Christ to call me. Thus I continued for a time, all
on a flame to be converted to Jesus Christ; and did also see at
that day, such glory in a converted state, that I could not be
contented without a share therein. Gold! could it have been gotten
for gold, what could I have given for it! had I a whole world it
had all gone ten thousand times over for this, that my soul might
have been in a converted state.</p>
<p><a id="id74" href="#id74">74</a>. How lovely now was everyone in my eyes that I thought to be
converted men and women! they shone, they walked like a people that
carried the broad seal of heaven about them. Oh! I saw the lot was
fallen to them in pleasant places, and they had a goodly heritage
(Ps. 16.6). But that which made me sick was that of Christ, in
Mark, He went up into a mountain and called to Him whom He would,
and they came unto Him (Mark 3.13).</p>
<p><a id="id75" href="#id75">75</a>. This scripture made me faint and fear, yet it kindled fire
in my soul. That which made me fear was this, lest Christ should
have no liking to me, for He called 'whom he would'. But oh! the
glory that I saw in that condition did still so engage my heart
that I could seldom read of any that Christ did call but I
presently wished, Would I had been in their clothes; would I had
been born Peter; would I had been born John; or would I had been by
and had heard Him when He called them, how would I have cried, O
Lord, call me also. But oh! I feared He would not call me.</p>
<p><a id="id76" href="#id76">76</a>. And truly the Lord let me go thus many months together and
showed me nothing; either that I was already, or should be called
hereafter. But at last, after much time spent, and many groans to
God, that I might be made partaker of the holy and heavenly
calling, that Word came in upon me: 'I will cleanse their blood
that I have not cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth in Zion' (Joel
3.21). These words I thought were sent to encourage me to wait
still upon God, and signified unto me, that if I were not already,
yet time might come, I might be in truth converted to Christ.</p>
<p><a id="id77" href="#id77">77</a>. About this time I began to break my mind to those poor
people in Bedford, and to tell them my condition, which, when they
had heard, they told Mr. Gifford of me, who himself also took
occasion to talk with me, and was willing to be well persuaded of
me, though I think but from little grounds: but he invited me to
his house, where I should hear him confer with others, about the
dealings of God with the soul; from all which I still received more
conviction, and from that time began to see something of the vanity
and inward wretchedness of my wicked heart, for as yet I knew no
great matter therein; but now it began to be discovered unto me,
and also to work at that rate for wickedness as it never did
before. Now I evidently found that lusts and corruptions would
strongly put forth themselves within me, in wicked thoughts and
desires, which I did not regard before; my desires for heaven and
life began to fail. I found also, that whereas my soul was full of
longing after God, now my heart began to hanker after every foolish
vanity; yea, my heart would not be moved to mind that that was
good; it began to be careless, both of my soul and heaven; it would
now continually hang back, both to, and in every duty; and was as a
clog on the leg of a bird to hinder her from flying.</p>
<p><a id="id78" href="#id78">78</a>. Nay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse; now am I farther
from conversion than ever I was before. Wherefore I began to sink
greatly in my soul, and began to entertain such discouragement in
my heart as laid me low as hell. If now I should have burned at a
stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for me; alas, I
could neither hear Him, nor see Him, nor feel Him, nor savour any
of His things; I was driven as with a tempest, my heart would be
unclean, the Canaanites would dwell in the land.</p>
<p><a id="id79" href="#id79">79</a>. Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people of God,
which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell me of
the promises; but they had as good have told me that I must reach
the sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely upon the
promise; and as soon as I should have done it, all my sense and
feeling was against me; and I saw I had a heart that would sin, and
that lay under a law that would condemn.</p>
<p><a id="id80" href="#id80">80</a>. These things have often made me think of that child which
the father brought to Christ, who, while he was yet a-coming to
him, was thrown down by the devil, and also so rent and torn by him
that he lay and wallowed, foaming (Luke 9.42, Mark 9.20).</p>
<p><a id="id81" href="#id81">81</a>. Further, in these days I should find my heart to shut itself
up against the Lord, and against His holy Word. I have found my
unbelief to set, as it were, the shoulder to the door to keep Him
out, and that too even then, when I have with many a bitter sigh
cried, Good Lord, break it open; Lord, break these gates of brass,
and cut these bars of iron asunder (Ps. 107.16). Yet that word
would sometimes create in my heart a peaceable pause, 'I girded
thee, though thou hast not known me' (Isa. 45.5).</p>
<p><a id="id82" href="#id82">82</a>. But all this while as to the act of sinning, I never was
more tender than now; I durst not take a pin or a stick, though but
so big as a straw, for my conscience now was sore, and would smart
at every touch; I could not now tell how to speak my words, for
fear I should misplace them. Oh, how gingerly did I then go in all
I did or said! I found myself as on a miry bog that shook if I did
but stir; and was there left both of God and Christ, and the
Spirit, and all good things.</p>
<p><a id="id83" href="#id83">83</a>. But, I observe, though I was such a great sinner before
conversion, yet God never much charged the guilt of the sins of my
ignorance upon me; only He showed me I was lost if I had not
Christ, because I had been a sinner; I saw that I wanted a perfect
righteousness to present me without fault before God, and this
righteousness was nowhere to be found, but in the person of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p><a id="id84" href="#id84">84</a>. But my original and inward pollution, that, that was my
plague and my affliction; that, I say, at a dreadful rate, always
putting forth itself within me; that I had the guilt of, to
amazement; by reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyes
than was a toad; and I thought I was so in God's eyes too; sin and
corruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my heart, as
water would bubble out of a fountain. I thought now that everyone
had a better heart than I had; I could have changed heart with
anybody; I thought none but the devil himself could equalize me for
inward wickedness and pollution of mind. I fell, therefore, at the
sight of my own vileness, deeply into despair; for I concluded that
this condition that I was in could not stand with a state of grace.
Sure, thought I, I am forsaken of God; sure I am given up to the
devil, and to a reprobate mind; and thus I continued a long while,
even for some years together.</p>
<p><a id="id85" href="#id85">85</a>. While I was thus afflicted with the fears of my own
damnation, there were two things would make me wonder; the one was,
when I saw old people hunting after the things of this life, as if
they should live here always; the other was, when I found
professors much distressed and cast down, when they met with
outward losses, as of husband, wife, child, etc. Lord, thought I,
what ado is here about such little things as these! What seeking
after carnal things by some, and what grief in others for the loss
of them! If they so much labour after, and spend so many tears for
the things of this present life, how am I to be bemoaned, pitied,
and prayed for! My soul is dying, my soul is damning. Were my soul
but in a good condition, and were I but sure of it, oh! how rich I
should esteem myself, though blessed but with bread and water; I
should count those but small afflictions, and should bear them as
little burdens. 'A wounded spirit who can bear?'</p>
<p><a id="id86" href="#id86">86</a>. And though I was thus troubled, and tossed, and afflicted,
with the sight and sense and terror of my own wickedness, yet I was
afraid to let this sight and sense go quite off my mind; for I
found that, unless guilt of conscience was taken off the right way,
that is, by the blood of Christ, a man grew rather worse for the
loss of his trouble of mind, than better. Wherefore, if my guilt
lay hard upon me, then I should cry that the blood of Christ might
take it off; and if it was going off without it (for the sense of
sin would be sometimes as if it would die, and go quite away), then
I would also strive to fetch it upon my heart again, by bringing
the punishment for sin in hell fire upon my spirits; and should
cry, Lord, let it not go off my heart, but the right way, but by
the blood of Christ, and by the application of Thy mercy, through
Him, to my soul; for that scripture lay much upon me, 'without
shedding of blood is no remission' (Heb. 9.22). And that which made
me the more afraid of this was, because I had seen some who, though
when they were under wounds of conscience, then they would cry and
pray; but they seeking rather present ease from their trouble, than
pardon for their sin, cared not how they lost their guilt, so they
got it out of their mind; and, therefore, having got it off the
wrong way, it was not sanctified unto them; but they grew harder
and blinder, and more wicked after their trouble. This made me
afraid, and made me cry to God the more, that it might not be so
with me.</p>
<p><a id="id87" href="#id87">87</a>. And now was I sorry that God had made me a man, for I feared
I was a reprobate; I counted man as unconverted, the most doleful
of all the creatures. Thus being afflicted and tossed about my sad
condition, I counted myself alone, and above the most of men
unblessed.</p>
<p><a id="id88" href="#id88">88</a>. Yea, I thought it impossible that ever I should attain to so
much goodness of heart, as to thank God that He had made me a man.
Man indeed is the most noble by creation, of all creatures in the
visible world; but by sin he has made himself the most ignoble. The
beasts, birds, fishes, etc., I blessed their condition, for they
had not a sinful nature, they were not obnoxious in the sight of
God; they were not to go to hell fire after death; I could
therefore have rejoiced had my condition been as any of theirs.</p>
<p><a id="id89" href="#id89">89</a>. In this condition I went a great while; but when comforting
time was come, I heard one preach a sermon upon those words in the
Song 4.1, 'Behold thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair.'
But at that time he made these two words, 'My love', his chief and
subject matter; from which, after he had a little opened the text,
he observed these several conclusions: 1. That the Church, and so
every saved soul, is Christ's love, when loveless. 2. Christ's love
without a cause. 3. Christ's love when hated of the world. 4.
Christ's love when under temptation, and under desertion. 5.
Christ's love from first to last.</p>
<p><a id="id90" href="#id90">90</a>. But I got nothing by what he said at present, only when he
came to the application of the fourth particular, this was the word
he said: If it be so, that the saved soul is Christ's love when
under temptation and desertion; then, poor tempted soul, when thou
art assaulted and afflicted with temptation, and the hidings of
God's face, yet think on these two words, 'My love', still.</p>
<p><a id="id91" href="#id91">91</a>. So as I was a-going home, these words came again into my
thoughts; and I well remember, as I came in, I said thus in my
heart, What shall I get by thinking on these two words? This
thought had no sooner passed through my heart, but the words began
thus to kindle in my spirit, 'Thou art my love, thou art my love',
twenty times together; and still as they ran thus in my mind, they
waxed stronger and warmer, and began to make me look up; but being
as yet between hope and fear, I still replied in my heart, But is
it true, but is it true? At which, that sentence fell in upon me,
he 'wist not that it was true which was done by the angel' (Acts
12.9).</p>
<p><a id="id92" href="#id92">92</a>. Then I began to give place to the word, which, with power,
did over and over make this joyful sound within my soul, Thou art
my love, thou art my love; and nothing shall separate thee from my
love; and with that, Rom 8.39 came into my mind. Now was my heart
filled full of comfort and hope, and now I could believe that my
sins should be forgiven me; yea, I was now so taken with the love
and mercy of God, that I remember I could not tell how to contain
till I got home; I thought I could have spoken of His love, and of
His mercy to me, even to the very crows that sat upon the ploughed
lands before me, had they been capable to have understood me;
wherefore I said in my soul with much gladness, Well, I would I had
a pen and ink here, I would write this down before I go any
farther, for surely I will not forget this forty years hence; but
alas! within less than forty days, I began to question all again;
which made me begin to question all still.</p>
<p><a id="id93" href="#id93">93</a>. Yet still at times, I was helped to believe that it was a
true manifestation of grace unto my soul, though I had lost much of
the life and savour of it. Now about a week or fortnight after
this, I was much followed by this scripture, 'Simon, Simon, behold
Satan hath desired to have you' (Luke 22.31). And sometimes it
would sound so loud within me, yea, and as it were call so strongly
after me, that once above all the rest, I turned my head over my
shoulder, thinking verily that some man had, behind me, called to
me; being at a great distance, methought he called so loud; it
came, as I have thought since, to have stirred me up to prayer, and
to watchfulness; it came to acquaint me that a cloud and a storm
was coming down upon me, but I understood it not.</p>
<p><a id="id94" href="#id94">94</a>. Also, as I remember, that time that it called to me so loud,
was the last time that it sounded in mine ear; but methinks I hear
still with what a loud voice these words, Simon, Simon, sounded in
mine ears. I thought verily, as I have told you, that somebody had
called after me, that was half a mile behind me; and although that
was not my name, yet it made me suddenly look behind me, believing
that he that called so loud meant me.</p>
<p><a id="id95" href="#id95">95</a>. But so foolish was I, and ignorant, that I knew not the
reason of this sound; which, as I did both see and feel soon after,
was sent from heaven as an alarm, to awaken me to provide for what
was coming; only it would make me muse and wonder in my mind, to
think what should be the reason that this scripture, and that at
this rate, so often and so loud, should still be sounding and
rattling in mine ears; but, as I said before, I soon after
perceived the end of God therein.</p>
<p><a id="id96" href="#id96">96</a>. For about the space of a month after, a very great storm
came down upon me, which handled me twenty times worse than all I
had met with before; it came stealing upon me, now by one piece,
then by another; first, all my comfort was taken from me, then
darkness seized upon me, after which whole floods of blasphemies,
both against God, Christ, and the Scriptures, were poured upon my
spirit, to my great confusion and astonishment. These blasphemous
thoughts were such as also stirred up questions in me, against the
very being of God, and of His only beloved Son; as whether there
were, in truth, a God, or Christ, or no? And whether the holy
Scriptures were not rather a fable, and cunning story, than the
holy and pure Word of God?</p>
<p><a id="id97" href="#id97">97</a>. The tempter would also much assault me with this, How can you
tell but that the Turks had as good Scriptures to prove their
Mahomet the Saviour, as we have to prove our Jesus is? And, could I
think, that so many ten thousands, in so many countries and
kingdoms, should be without the knowledge of the right way to
heaven; if there were indeed a heaven, and that we only, who live
in a corner of the earth, should alone be blessed therewith?
Everyone doth think his own religion rightest, both Jews and Moors,
and Pagans! and how if all our faith, and Christ, and Scriptures,
should be but a think-so too?</p>
<p><a id="id98" href="#id98">98</a>. Sometimes I have endeavoured to argue against these
suggestions, and to set some of the sentences of blessed Paul
against them; but, alas! I quickly felt, when I thus did, such
arguings as these would return again upon me, Though we made so
great a matter of Paul, and of his words, yet how could I tell, but
that in very deed, he being a subtle and cunning man, might give
himself up to deceive with strong delusions; and also take both
that pains and travail, to undo and destroy his fellows?</p>
<p><a id="id99" href="#id99">99</a>. These suggestions, with many other which at this time I may
not, nor dare not utter, neither by word nor pen, did make such a
seizure upon my spirit, and did so overweigh my heart, both with
their number, continuance, and fiery force, that I felt as if there
were nothing else but these from morning to night within me; and as
though, indeed, there could be room for nothing else; and also
concluded that God had, in very wrath to my soul, given me up unto
them, to be carried away with them, as with a mighty whirlwind.</p>
<p><a id="id100" href="#id100">100</a>. Only by the distaste that they gave unto my spirit, I felt
there was something in me that refused to embrace them. But this
consideration I then only had, when God gave me leave to swallow my
spittle, otherwise the noise, and strength, and force of these
temptations, would drown and overflow, and as it were bury all such
thoughts or the remembrance of any such thing. While I was in this
temptation, I should often find my mind suddenly put upon it, to
curse and swear, or to speak some grievous thing against God, or
Christ His Son, and of the Scriptures.</p>
<p><a id="id101" href="#id101">101</a>. Now I thought, surely I am possessed of the devil; at other
times again, I thought I should be bereft of my wits; for instead
of lauding and magnifying God the Lord with others, if I have but
heard Him spoken of, presently some most horrible blasphemous
thought or other would bolt out of my heart against Him; so that
whether I did think that God was, or again did think there were no
such thing, no love, nor peace, nor gracious disposition could I
feel within me.</p>
<p><a id="id102" href="#id102">102</a>. These things did sink me into very deep despair; for I
concluded, that such things could not possibly be found amongst
them that loved God. I often, when these temptations have been with
force upon me, did compare myself in the case of such a child, whom
some gipsy hath by force took up under her apron, and is carrying
from friend and country; kick sometimes I did, and also scream and
cry; but yet I was as bound in the wings of the temptation, and the
wind would carry me away. I thought also of Saul, and of the evil
spirit that did possess him; and did greatly fear that my condition
was the same with that of his (1 Sam. 16.14).</p>
<p><a id="id103" href="#id103">103</a>. In these days, when I have heard others talk of what was
the sin against the Holy Ghost, then would the tempter so provoke
me to desire to sin that sin, that I was as if I could not, must
not, neither should be quiet until I had committed that; now, no
sin would serve but that; if it were to be committed by speaking of
such a word, then I have been as if my mouth would have spoken that
word, whether I would or no; and in so strong a measure was this
temptation upon me, that often I have been ready to clap my hand
under my chin, to hold my mouth from opening; and to that end also
I have had thoughts at other times, to leap with my head downward,
into some muck-hill hole or other, to keep my mouth from
speaking.</p>
<p><a id="id104" href="#id104">104</a>. Now I blessed the condition of the dog and toad, and
counted the estate of everything that God had made far better than
this dreadful state of mine, and such as my companions was; yea,
gladly would I have been in the condition of dog or horse, for I
knew they had no soul to perish under the everlasting weights of
hell for sin, as mine was like to do. Nay, and though I saw this,
felt this, and was broken to pieces with it, yet that which added
to my sorrow was, that I could not find that with all my soul I did
desire deliverance. That scripture did also tear and rend my soul,
in the midst of these distractions, 'The wicked are like the
troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and
dirt. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked' (Isa. 57.20,
21).</p>
<p><a id="id105" href="#id105">105</a>. And now my heart was, at times, exceeding hard; if I would
have given a thousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed one; no,
nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one. I was much dejected to
think that this should be my lot. I saw some could mourn and lament
their sin; and others, again, could rejoice, and bless God for
Christ; and others, again, could quietly talk of, and with gladness
remember, the Word of God; while I only was in the storm or
tempest. This much sunk me; I thought my condition was alone. I
should, therefore, much bewail my hard hap; but get out of, or get
rid of, these things, I could not.</p>
<p><a id="id106" href="#id106">106</a>. While this temptation lasted, which was about a year, I
could attend upon none of the ordinances of God but with sore and
great affliction. Yea, then was I most distressed with blasphemies;
if I have been hearing the Word, then uncleanness, blasphemies and
despair would hold me as captive there; if I have been reading,
then, sometimes, I had sudden thoughts to question all I read;
sometimes, again, my mind would be so strangely snatched away, and
possessed with other things, that I have neither known, nor
regarded, nor remembered so much as the sentence that but now I
have read.</p>
<p><a id="id107" href="#id107">107</a>. In prayer, also, I have been greatly troubled at this time;
sometimes I have thought I should see the devil; nay, thought I
have felt him, behind me, pull my clothes; he would be, also,
continually at me in the time of prayer to have done; break off,
make haste, you have prayed enough, and stay no longer, still
drawing my mind away. Sometimes, also, he would cast in such wicked
thoughts as these: that I must pray to him, or for him. I have
thought sometimes of that-Fall down, or, 'if thou wilt fall down
and worship me' (Matt. 4.9).</p>
<p><a id="id108" href="#id108">108</a>. Also, when, because I have had wandering thoughts in the
time of this duty, I have laboured to compose my mind and fix it
upon God, then, with great force, hath the tempter laboured to
distract me, and confound me, and to turn away my mind, by
presenting to my heart and fancy the form of a bush, a bull, a
besom, or the like, as if I should pray to those; to these he
would, also, at some times especially, so hold my mind that I was
as if I could think of nothing else, or pray to nothing else but to
these, or such as they.</p>
<p><a id="id109" href="#id109">109</a>. Yet, at times I should have some strong and heart-affecting
apprehensions of God, and the reality of the truth of His gospel;
but, oh! how would my heart, at such times, put forth itself with
inexpressible groanings. My whole soul was then in every word; I
should cry with pangs after God that He would be merciful unto me;
but then I should be daunted again with such conceits as these: I
should think that God did mock at these, my prayers, saying, and
that in the audience of the holy angels, This poor simple wretch
doth hanker after Me as if I had nothing to do with My mercy but to
bestow it on such as he. Alas, poor fool! how art thou deceived; It
is not for such as thee to have favour with the Highest.</p>
<p><a id="id110" href="#id110">110</a>. Then hath the tempter come upon me, also, with such
discouragements as these: You are very hot for mercy, but I will
cool you; this frame shall not last always; many have been as hot
as you for a spirit, but I have quenched their zeal. And with this,
such and such who were fallen off would be set before mine eyes.
Then I should be afraid that I should do so too; but, thought I, I
am glad this comes into my mind. Well, I will watch, and take what
heed I can. Though you do, said Satan, I shall be too hard for you;
I will cool you insensibly, by degrees, by little and little. What
care I, saith he, though I be seven years in chilling your heart if
I can do it at last? Continual rocking will lull a crying child
asleep. I will ply it close, but I will have my end accomplished.
Though you be burning hot at present, yet, if I can pull you from
this fire, I shall have you cold before it be long.</p>
<p><a id="id111" href="#id111">111</a>. These things brought me into great straits; for as I at
present could not find myself fit for present death, so I thought
to live long would make me yet more unfit; for time would make me
forget all, and wear even the remembrance of the evil of sin, the
worth of heaven, and the need I had of the blood of Christ to wash
me, both out of mind and thought; but I thank Christ Jesus these
things did not at present make me slack my crying, but rather did
put me more upon it, like her who met with the adulterer (Deut.
22.27); in which days that was a good word to me after I had
suffered these things a while: 'I am persuaded that
neither_5height, nor depth, nor life,' etc., 'shall_5separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus' (Rom. 8.38). And
now I hoped long life should not destroy me, nor make me miss of
heaven.</p>
<p><a id="id112" href="#id112">112</a>. Yet I had some supports in this temptation, though they
were then all questioned by me; that in the third of Jeremiah, at
the first, was something to me, and so was the consideration of the
fifth verse of that chapter; that though we have spoken and done as
evil things as we could, yet we should cry unto God, 'My Father,
Thou art the guide of my youth'; and should return unto Him.</p>
<p><a id="id113" href="#id113">113</a>. I had, also, once a sweet glance from that in II Cor. 5.21:
'For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him.' I remember, also,
that one day as I was sitting in a neighbour's house, and there
very sad at the consideration of my many blasphemies, and as I was
saying in my mind, What ground have I to think that I, who have
been so vile and abominable, should ever inherit eternal life? that
word came suddenly upon me, 'What shall we then say to these
things? If God be for us, who can be against us?' (Rom. 8.31).
That, also, was an help unto me, 'Because I live, ye shall live
also' (John 14.19). But these were but hints, touches, and short
visits, though very sweet when present; only they lasted not; but,
like to Peter's sheet, of a sudden were caught up from me to heaven
again (Acts 10.16).</p>
<p><a id="id114" href="#id114">114</a>. But afterwards the Lord did more fully and graciously
discover Himself unto me; and, indeed, did quite, not only deliver
me from the guilt that, by these things, was laid upon my
conscience, but also from the very filth thereof; for the
temptation was removed, and I was put into my right mind again, as
other Christians were.</p>
<p><a id="id115" href="#id115">115</a>. I remember that one day, as I was travelling into the
country and musing on the wickedness and blasphemy of my heart, and
considering of the enmity that was in me to God, that scripture
came in my mind, He hath 'made peace through the blood of his
cross' (Col. 1.20). By which I was made to see, both again, and
again, and again, that day, that God and my soul were friends by
this blood; yea, I saw that the justice of God and my sinful soul
could embrace and kiss each other through this blood. This was a
good day to me; I hope I shall not forget it.</p>
<p><a id="id116" href="#id116">116</a>. At another time, as I sat by the fire in my house, and
musing on my wretchedness, the Lord made that also a precious word
unto me, 'Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh
and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
through death he might destroy him that had the power of death,
that is, the devil, and deliver them who, through fear of death,
were all their lifetime subject to bondage' (Heb. 2.14, 15). I
thought that the glory of these words was then so weighty on me
that I was, both once and twice, ready to swoon as I sat; yet not
with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and peace.</p>
<p><a id="id117" href="#id117">117</a>. At this time, also, I sat under the ministry of holy Mr.
Gifford, whose doctrine, by God's grace, was much for my stability.
This man made it much his business to deliver the people of God
from all those faults and unsound rests that, by nature, we are
prone to take and make to our souls. He pressed up to take special
heed that we took not up any truth upon trust-as from this, or
that, or any other man or men- but to cry mightily to God that He
would convince us of the reality thereof, and set us down therein,
by His own Spirit, in the holy Word; for, said he, if you do
otherwise when temptations come, if strongly, you, not having
received them with evidence from heaven, will find you want that
help and strength now to resist as once you thought you had.</p>
<p><a id="id118" href="#id118">118</a>. This was as seasonable to my soul as the former and latter
rain in their season; for I had found, and that by sad experience,
the truth of these his words; for I had felt what no man can say,
especially when tempted by the devil, that Jesus Christ is Lord but
by the Holy Ghost. Wherefore I found my soul, through grace, very
apt to drink in this doctrine, and to incline to pray to God that,
in nothing that pertained to God's glory and my own eternal
happiness, He would suffer me to be without the confirmation
thereof from heaven; for now I saw clearly there was an exceeding
difference betwixt the notions of flesh and blood, and the
revelations of God in heaven; also, a great difference between that
faith that is feigned, and according to man's wisdom, and of that
which comes by a man's being born thereto of God (Matt. 16.15- 17;
1 John 5.1).</p>
<p><a id="id119" href="#id119">119</a>. But, oh! now, how was my soul led from truth to truth by
God! even from the birth and cradle of the Son of God to His
ascension and second coming from heaven to judge the world.</p>
<p><a id="id120" href="#id120">120</a>. Truly, I then found, upon this account, the great God was
very good unto me; for, to my remembrance, there was not anything
that I then cried unto God to make known and reveal unto me but He
was pleased to do it for me; I mean not one part of the gospel of
the Lord Jesus, but I was orderly led into it. Methought I saw with
great evidence, from the relation of the four evangelists, the
wonderful work of God, in giving Jesus Christ to save us, from His
conception and birth even to His second coming to judgment.
Methought I was as if I had seen Him born, as if I had seen Him
grow up, as if I had seen Him walk through this world, from the
cradle to His cross: to which, also, when He came, I saw how gently
He gave Himself to be hanged and nailed on it for my sins and
wicked doings. Also, as I was musing on this, His progress, that
dropped on my spirit, He was ordained for the slaughter (1 Pet.
1.19, 20).</p>
<p><a id="id121" href="#id121">121</a>. When I have considered also the truth of His resurrection,
and have remembered that word, 'Touch me not, Mary,' etc., I have
seen as if He leaped at the grave's mouth for joy that He was risen
again, and had got the conquest over our dreadful foes (John
20.17). I have also, in the spirit, seen Him a man on the right
hand of God the Father for me, and have seen the manner of His
coming from heaven to judge the world with glory, and have been
confirmed in these things by these scriptures following, Acts 1.9,
10; 7.56; 10.42; Heb. 7.24; 8.3; Rev. 1.18; 1 Thess. 4.17, 18.</p>
<p><a id="id122" href="#id122">122</a>. Once I was much troubled to know whether the Lord Jesus was
both man as well as God, and God as well as man; and truly, in
those days, let men say what they would, unless I had it with
evidence from heaven, all was as nothing to me, I counted not
myself set down in any truth of God. Well, I was much troubled
about this point, and could not tell how to be resolved; at last,
that in the fifth of the Revelations came into my mind, 'And I
beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts,
and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb.' In the midst of the
throne, thought I, there is His Godhead; in the midst of the
elders, there is His manhood; but oh! methought this did glister!
it was a goodly touch, and gave me sweet satisfaction. That other
scripture also did help me much in this, 'To us a child is born,
unto us a son is given; and the government shall be on his
shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace,' etc.
(Isa. 9.6).</p>
<p><a id="id123" href="#id123">123</a>. Also, besides these teachings of God in His Word, the Lord
made use of two things to confirm me in these things; the one was
the errors of the Quakers, and the other was the guilt of sin; for
as the Quakers did oppose His truth, so God did the more confirm me
in it, by leading me into the scriptures that did wonderfully
maintain it.</p>
<p><a id="id124" href="#id124">124</a>. The errors that this people then maintained were: 1. That
the holy Scriptures were not the Word of God. 2. That every man in
the world had the spirit of Christ, grace, faith, etc. 3. That
Christ Jesus, as crucified, and dying 1600 years ago, did not
satisfy divine justice for the sins of the people. 4. That Christ's
flesh and blood was within the saints. 5. That the bodies of the
good and bad that are buried in the churchyard shall not arise
again. 6. That the resurrection is past with good men already. 7.
That that man Jesus, that was crucified between two thieves on
Mount Calvary, in the land of Canaan, by Jerusalem, was not
ascended up above the starry heavens. 8. That He should not, even
the same Jesus that died by the hands of the Jews, come again at
the last day, and as man judge all nations, etc.</p>
<p><a id="id125" href="#id125">125</a>. Many more vile and abominable things were in those days
fomented by them, by which I was driven to a more narrow search of
the Scriptures, and was, through their light and testimony, not
only enlightened, but greatly confirmed and comforted in the truth;
and, as I said, the guilt of sin did help me much, for still as
that would come upon me, the blood of Christ did take it off again,
and again, and again, and that too, sweetly, according to the
Scriptures. O friends! cry to God to reveal Jesus Christ unto you;
there is none teacheth like Him.</p>
<p><a id="id126" href="#id126">126</a>. It would be too long for me here to stay, to tell you in
particular how God did set me down in all the things of Christ, and
how He did, that He might do so, lead me into His words; yea, and
also how He did open them unto me, make them shine before me, and
comfort me over and over, both of His own being, and the being of
His Son, and Spirit, and Word, and gospel.</p>
<p><a id="id127" href="#id127">127</a>. Only this, as I said before I will say unto you again, that
in general He was pleased to take this course with me; first, to
suffer me to be afflicted with temptation concerning them, and then
reveal them to me: as sometimes I should lie under great guilt for
sin, even crushed to the ground therewith, and then the Lord would
show me the death of Christ; yea, and so sprinkle my conscience
with His blood, that I should find, and that before I was aware,
that in that conscience where but just now did reign and rage the
law, even there would rest and abide the peace and love of God
through Christ.</p>
<p><a id="id128" href="#id128">128</a>. Now had I an evidence, as I thought, of my salvation from
heaven, with many golden seals thereon, all hanging in my sight;
now could I remember this manifestation and the other discovery of
grace, with comfort; and should often long and desire that the last
day were come, that I might for ever be inflamed with the sight,
and joy, and communion with Him whose head was crowned with thorns,
whose face was spit on, and body broken, and soul made an offering
for my sins: for whereas, before, I lay continually trembling at
the mouth of hell, now methought I was got so far therefrom that I
could not, when I looked back, scarce discern it; and oh! thought
I, that I were fourscore years old now, that I might die quickly,
that my soul might be gone to rest.</p>
<p><a id="id129" href="#id129">129</a>. But before I had got thus far out of these my temptations,
I did greatly long to see some ancient godly man's experience, who
had writ some hundreds of years before I was born; for those who
had writ in our days, I thought, but I desire them now to pardon
me, that they had writ only that which others felt, or else had,
through the strength of their wits and parts, studied to answer
such objections as they perceived others were perplexed with,
without going down themselves into the deep. Well, after many such
longings in my mind, the God in whose hands are all our days and
ways, did cast into my hand, one day, a book of Martin Luther; it
was his comment on the Galatians-it also was so old that it was
ready to fall piece from piece if I did but turn it over. Now I was
pleased much that such an old book had fallen into my hands; the
which, when I had but a little way perused, I found my condition,
in his experience, so largely and profoundly handled, as if his
book had been written out of my heart. This made me marvel; for
thus thought I, This man could not know anything of the state of
Christians now, but must needs write and speak the experience of
former days.</p>
<p><a id="id130" href="#id130">130</a>. Besides, he doth most gravely, also, in that book, debate
of the rise of these temptations, namely, blasphemy, desperation,
and the like; showing that the law of Moses as well as the devil,
death, and hell hath a very great hand therein, the which, at
first, was very strange to me; but considering and watching, I
found it so indeed. But of particulars here I intend nothing; only
this, methinks, I must let fall before all men, I do prefer this
book of Martin Luther upon the Galatians, excepting the Holy Bible,
before all the books that ever I have seen, as most fit for a
wounded conscience.</p>
<p><a id="id131" href="#id131">131</a>. And now I found, as I thought, that I loved Christ dearly;
oh! methought my soul cleaved unto Him, my affections cleaved unto
Him, I felt love unto Him as hot as fire; and now, as Job said, I
thought I should die in my nest; but I did quickly find that my
great love was but little, and that I, who had, as I thought, such
burning love to Jesus Christ, could let Him go again for a very
trifle; God can tell how to abase us, and can hide pride from man.
Quickly after this my love was tried to purpose.</p>
<p><a id="id132" href="#id132">132</a>. For after the Lord had, in this manner, thus graciously
delivered me from this great and sore temptation, and had set me
down so sweetly in the faith of His holy gospel, and had given me
such strong consolation and blessed evidence from heaven touching
my interest in His love through Christ; the tempter came upon me
again, and that with a more grievous and dreadful temptation than
before.</p>
<p><a id="id133" href="#id133">133</a>. And that was, To sell and part with this most blessed
Christ, to exchange Him for the things of this life, for anything.
The temptation lay upon me for the space of a year, and did follow
me so continually that I was not rid of it one day in a month, no,
not sometimes one hour in many days together, unless when I was
asleep.</p>
<p><a id="id134" href="#id134">134</a>. And though, in my judgment, I was persuaded that those who
were once effectually in Christ, as I hoped, through His grace, I
had seen myself, could never lose Him for ever-for 'the land shall
not be sold for ever, for the land is mine,' saith God (Lev.
25.23)-yet it was a continual vexation to me to think that I should
have so much as one such thought within me against a Christ, a
Jesus, that had done for me as He had done; and yet then I had
almost none others, but such blasphemous ones.</p>
<p><a id="id135" href="#id135">135</a>. But it was neither my dislike of the thought, nor yet any
desire and endeavour to resist it that in the least did shake or
abate the continuation, or force and strength thereof; for it did
always, in almost whatever I thought, intermix itself therewith in
such sort that I could neither eat my food, stoop for a pin, chop a
stick, or cast mine eye to look on this, or that, but still the
temptation would come, Sell Christ for this, or sell Christ for
that; sell Him, sell Him.</p>
<p><a id="id136" href="#id136">136</a>. Sometimes it would run in my thoughts, not so little as a
hundred times together, Sell Him, sell Him, sell Him; against which
I may say, for whole hours together, I have been forced to stand as
continually leaning and forcing my spirit against it, lest haply,
before I were aware, some wicked thought might arise in my heart
that might consent thereto; and sometimes also the tempter would
make me believe I had consented to it, then should I be as tortured
upon a rack for whole days together.</p>
<p><a id="id137" href="#id137">137</a>. This temptation did put me to such scares, lest I should at
sometimes, I say, consent thereto, and be overcome therewith, that
by the very force of my mind in labouring to gainsay and resist
this wickedness, my very body also would be put into action or
motion by way of pushing or thrusting with my hands or elbows,
still answering as fast as the destroyer said, Sell Him; I will
not, I will not, I will not, I will not; no, not for thousands,
thousands, thousands of worlds. Thus reckoning lest I should in the
midst of these assaults, set too low a value of Him, even until I
scarce well knew where I was, or how to be composed again.</p>
<p><a id="id138" href="#id138">138</a>. At these seasons he would not let me eat my food at quiet;
but, forsooth, when I was set at the table at my meat, I must go
hence to pray; I must leave my food now, and just now, so
counterfeit holy also would this devil be. When I was thus tempted,
I should say in myself, Now I am at my meat, let me make an end.
No, said he, you must do it now, or you will displease God, and
despise Christ. Wherefore I was much afflicted with these things;
and because of the sinfulness of my nature, imagining that these
things were impulses from God, I should deny to do it, as if I
denied God; and then should I be as guilty, because I did not obey
a temptation of the devil, as if I had broken the law of God
indeed.</p>
<p><a id="id139" href="#id139">139</a>. But to be brief, one morning, as I did lie in my bed, I
was, at other times, most fiercely assaulted with this temptation,
to sell and part with Christ; the wicked suggestion still running
in my mind, Sell Him, sell Him, sell Him, sell Him, sell Him, as
fast as a man could speak; against which also, in my mind, as at
other times, I answered, No, no, not for thousands, thousands,
thousands, at least twenty times together. But at last, after much
striving, even until I was almost out of breath, I felt this
thought pass through my heart, Let Him go, if He will! and I
thought also, that I felt my heart freely consent thereto. Oh, the
diligence of Satan! Oh, the desperateness of man's heart!</p>
<p><a id="id140" href="#id140">140</a>. Now was the battle won, and down I fell, as a bird that is
shot from the top of a tree, into great guilt, and fearful despair.
Thus getting out of my bed, I went moping into the field; but God
knows, with as heavy a heart as mortal man, I think, could bear;
where, for the space of two hours, I was like a man bereft of life,
and as now past all recovery, and bound over to eternal
punishment.</p>
<p><a id="id141" href="#id141">141</a>. And withal, that scripture did seize upon my soul, 'Or
profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat, sold his
birthright; for ye know, how that afterward, when he would have
inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of
repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears' (Heb.
12.16,17).</p>
<p><a id="id142" href="#id142">142</a>. Now was I as one bound, I felt myself shut up unto the
judgment to come; nothing now for two years together would abide
with me, but damnation, and an expectation of damnation; I say,
nothing now would abide with me but this, save some few moments for
relief, as in the sequel you will see.</p>
<p><a id="id143" href="#id143">143</a>. These words were to my soul like fetters of brass to my
legs, in the continual sound of which I went for several months
together. But about ten or eleven o'clock one day, as I was walking
under a hedge, full of sorrow and guilt, God knows, and bemoaning
myself for this hard hap that such a thought should arise within
me; suddenly this sentence bolted in upon me, The blood of Christ
remits all guilt. At this I made a stand in my spirit; with that,
this word took hold upon me, 'The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
cleanseth us from all sin' (1 John 1.7).</p>
<p><a id="id144" href="#id144">144</a>. Now I began to conceive peace in my soul, and methought I
saw as if the tempter did leer and steal away from me, as being
ashamed of what he had done. At the same time also I had my sin,
and the blood of Christ thus represented to me, that my sin, when
compared to the blood of Christ, was no more to it, than this
little clot or stone before me, is to this vast and wide field that
here I see. This gave me good encouragement for the space of two or
three hours; in which time also, methought I saw, by faith, the Son
of God, as suffering for my sins; but because it tarried not, I
therefore sunk in my spirit, under exceeding guilt again.</p>
<p><a id="id145" href="#id145">145</a>. But chiefly by the afore-mentioned scripture, concerning
Esau's selling of his birthright; for that scripture would lie all
day long, all the week long, yea, all the year long in my mind, and
hold me down, so that I could by no means lift up myself; for when
I would strive to turn me to this scripture, or that, for relief,
still that sentence would be sounding in me, 'For ye know, how that
afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing_5he found no
place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.'</p>
<p><a id="id146" href="#id146">146</a>. Sometimes, also, I should have a touch from that in Luke
22.32, 'I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not'; but it
would not abide upon me; neither could I indeed, when I considered
my state, find ground to conceive in the least, that there should
be the root of that grace within me, having sinned as I had done.
Now was I torn and rent in heavy case, for many days together.</p>
<p><a id="id147" href="#id147">147</a>. Then began I with sad and careful heart, to consider of the
nature and largeness of my sin, and to search in the Word of God,
if I could in any place espy a word of promise, or any encouraging
sentence by which I might take relief. Wherefore I began to
consider that third of Mark, All manner of sins and blasphemies
shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, wherewith soever they shall
blaspheme. Which place, methought, at a blush, did contain a large
and glorious promise, for the pardon of high offences; but
considering the place more fully, I thought it was rather to be
understood as relating more chiefly to those who had, while in a
natural state, committed such things as there are mentioned; but
not to me, who had not only received light and mercy, but that had,
both after, and also contrary to that, so slighted Christ as I had
done.</p>
<p><a id="id148" href="#id148">148</a>. I feared therefore that this wicked sin of mine might be
that sin unpardonable, of which he there thus speaketh, 'But he
that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness,
but is in danger of eternal damnation' (Mark 3.29). And I did the
rather give credit to this, because of that sentence in the
Hebrews, 'For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have
inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of
repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.' And this
stuck always with me.</p>
<p><a id="id149" href="#id149">149</a>. And now was I both a burden and a terror to myself, nor did
I ever so know, as now, what it was to be weary of my life, and yet
afraid to die. Oh, how gladly now would I have been anybody but
myself! Anything but a man! and in any condition but mine own! for
there was nothing did pass more frequently over my mind, than that
it was impossible for me to be forgiven my transgression, and to be
saved from wrath to come.</p>
<p><a id="id150" href="#id150">150</a>. And now began I to labour to call again time that was past;
wishing a thousand times twice told, that the day was yet to come,
when I should be tempted to such a sin; concluding with great
indignation, both against my heart, and all assaults, how I would
rather have been torn in pieces, than found a consenter thereto.
But alas! these thoughts, and wishings, and resolvings, were now
too late to help me; the thought had passed my heart, God hath let
me go, and I am fallen. Oh! thought I, 'that it was with me as in
months past, as in the days when God preserved me!' (Job 29.2).</p>
<p><a id="id151" href="#id151">151</a>. Then again, being loath and unwilling to perish, I began to
compare my sin with others, to see if I could find that any of
those that were saved had done as I had done. So I considered
David's adultery and murder, and found them most heinous crimes;
and those too committed after light and grace received; but yet by
considering, I perceived that his transgressions were only such as
were against the law of Moses; from which the Lord Christ could,
with the consent of His Word, deliver him; but mine was against the
gospel, yea, against the Mediator thereof; I had sold my
Saviour.</p>
<p><a id="id152" href="#id152">152</a>. Now again should I be as if racked upon the wheel, when I
considered, that, besides the guilt that possessed me, I should be
so void of grace, so bewitched. What, thought I, must it be no sin
but this? Must it needs be the great transgression (Ps. 19.13)?
Must that wicked one touch my soul (1 John 5.18)? Oh, what stings
did I find in all these sentences!</p>
<p><a id="id153" href="#id153">153</a>. What, thought I, is there but one sin that is unpardonable?
But one sin that layeth the soul without the reach of God's mercy;
and must I be guilty of that? Must it needs be that? Is there but
one sin among so many millions of sins, for which there is no
forgiveness; and must I commit this? Oh, unhappy sin! Oh, unhappy
man! These things would so break and confound my spirit, that I
could not tell what to do; I thought, at times, they would have
broke my wits; and still, to aggravate my misery, that would run in
my mind, 'Ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
the blessing, he was rejected.' Oh! none knows the terrors of those
days but myself.</p>
<p><a id="id154" href="#id154">154</a>. After this I came to consider of Peter's sin, which he
committed in denying his Master; and indeed, this came nighest to
mine, of any that I could find; for he had denied his Saviour, as
I, and that after light and mercy received; yea, and that too,
after warning given him. I also considered, that he did it both
once and twice; and that, after time to consider betwixt. But
though I put all these circumstances together, that, if possible, I
might find help, yet I considered again, that his was but a denial
of his Master, but mine was a selling of my Saviour. Wherefore I
thought with myself, that I came nearer to Judas, than either to
David or Peter.</p>
<p><a id="id155" href="#id155">155</a>. Here again my torment would flame out and afflict me; yea,
it would grind me, as it were, to powder, to discern the
preservation of God towards others, while I fell into the snare;
for in my thus considering of other men's sins, and comparing of
them with my own, I could evidently see how God preserved them,
notwithstanding their wickedness, and would not let them, as he had
let me, to become a son of perdition.</p>
<p><a id="id156" href="#id156">156</a>. But oh, how did my soul, at this time, prize the
preservation that God did set about his people! Ah, how safely did
I see them walk, whom God had hedged in! They were within His care,
protection, and special providence; though they were full as bad as
I by nature; yet because He loved them, He would not suffer them to
fall without the range of mercy; but as for me, I was gone, I had
done it; He would not preserve me, nor keep me; but suffered me,
because I was a reprobate, to fall as I had done. Now, did those
blessed places, that spake of God's keeping His people, shine like
the sun before me, though not to comfort me, but to show me the
blessed state and heritage of those whom the Lord had blessed.</p>
<p><a id="id157" href="#id157">157</a>. Now I saw, that as God had His hand in all providences and
dispensation that overtook His elect, so He had His hand in all the
temptations that they had to sin against Him, not to animate them
unto wickedness, but to choose their temptations and troubles for
them; and also to leave them, for a time, to such sins only as
might not destroy, but humble them; as might not put them beyond,
but lay them in the way of the renewing of His mercy. But oh, what
love, what care, what kindness and mercy did I now see, mixing
itself with the most severe and dreadful of all God's ways to His
people! He would let David, Hezekiah, Solomon, Peter, and others
fall, but He would not let them fall into sin unpardonable, nor
into hell for sin. Oh! thought I, these be the men that God hath
loved; these be the men that God, though He chastiseth them, keeps
them in safety by Him, and them whom He makes to abide under the
shadow of the Almighty. But all these thoughts added sorrow, grief,
and horror to me, as whatever I now thought on, it was killing to
me. If I thought how God kept His own, that was killing to me. If I
thought of how I was falling myself, that was killing to me. As all
things wrought together for the best, and to do good to them that
were the called, according to His purpose; so I thought that all
things wrought for my damage, and for my eternal overthrow.</p>
<p><a id="id158" href="#id158">158</a>. Then, again, I began to compare my sin with the sin of
Judas, that, if possible, I might find that mine differed from that
which, in truth, is unpardonable. And, oh! thought I, if it should
differ from it, though but the breadth of an hair, what a happy
condition is my soul in! And, by considering, I found that Judas
did his intentionally, but mine was against my prayer and
strivings; besides, his was committed with much deliberation, but
mine in a fearful hurry, on a sudden; all this while I was tossed
to and fro, like the locusts, and driven from trouble to sorrow;
hearing always the sound of Esau's fall in mine ears, and of the
dreadful consequences thereof.</p>
<p><a id="id159" href="#id159">159</a>. Yet this consideration about Judas, his sin, was, for a
while, some little relief unto me; for I saw I had not, as to the
circumstances, transgressed so foully as he. But this was quickly
gone again, for, I thought with myself, there might be more ways
than one to commit the unpardonable sin; also I thought that there
might be degrees of that, as well as of other transgressions;
wherefore, for aught I yet could perceive, this iniquity of mine
might be such, as might never be passed by.</p>
<p><a id="id160" href="#id160">160</a>. I was often now ashamed, that I should be like such an ugly
man as Judas; I thought, also, how loathsome I should be unto all
the saints at the day of judgment; insomuch, that now I could
scarce see a good man, that I believed had a good conscience, but I
should feel my heart tremble at him, while I was in his presence.
Oh! now I saw a glory in walking with God, and what a mercy it was
to have a good conscience before Him.</p>
<p><a id="id161" href="#id161">161</a>. I was much about this time tempted to content myself, by
receiving some false opinion; as that there should be no such thing
as a day of judgment, that we should not rise again, and that sin
was no such grievous thing; the tempter suggesting thus, For if
these things should indeed be true, yet to believe otherwise, would
yield you ease for the present. If you must perish, never torment
yourself so much beforehand; drive the thoughts of damning out of
your mind, by possessing your mind with some such conclusions that
Atheists and Ranters do use to help themselves withal.</p>
<p><a id="id162" href="#id162">162</a>. But oh! when such thoughts have led through my heart, how,
as it were, within a step, hath death and judgment been in my view;
methought the judge stood at the door, I was as if it was come
already; so that such things could have no entertainment. But,
methinks, I see by this, that Satan will use any means to keep the
soul from Christ; he loveth not an awakened frame of spirit;
security, blindness, darkness, and error is the very kingdom and
habitation of the wicked one.</p>
<p><a id="id163" href="#id163">163</a>. I found it hard work now to pray to God, because despair
was swallowing me up; I thought I was, as with a tempest, driven
away from God, for always when I cried to God for mercy, this would
come in, It is too late, I am lost, God hath let me fall; not to my
correction, but condemnation; my sin is unpardonable; and I know,
concerning Esau, how that, after he had sold his birthright, he
would have received the blessing, but was rejected. About this
time, I did light on that dreadful story of that miserable mortal,
Francis Spira; a book that was to my troubled spirit as salt, when
rubbed into a fresh wound; every sentence in that book, every groan
of that man, with all the rest of his actions in his dolours, as
his tears, his prayers, his gnashing of teeth, his wringing of
hands, his twining and twisting, languishing and pining away under
that mighty hand of God that was upon him, was as knives and
daggers in my soul; especially that sentence of his was frightful
to me, Man knows the beginning of sin, but who bounds the issues
thereof? Then would the former sentence, as the conclusion of all,
fall like a hot thunderbolt again</p>
<p>upon my conscience; 'for you know how that afterward, when he
would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no
place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.'</p>
<p><a id="id164" href="#id164">164</a>. Then was I struck into a very great trembling, insomuch
that at sometimes I could, for whole days together, feel my very
body, as well as my mind, to shake and totter under the sense of
the dreadful judgment of God, that should fall on those that have
sinned that most fearful and unpardonable sin. I felt also such a
clogging and heat at my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that
I was, especially at some times, as if my breast bone would have
split in sunder; then I thought of that concerning Judas, who, by
his falling headlong, burst asunder, and all his bowels gushed out
(Acts 1:18).</p>
<p><a id="id165" href="#id165">165</a>. I feared also that this was the mark that the Lord did set
on Cain, even continued fear and trembling, under the heavy load of
guilt that he had charged on him for the blood of his brother Abel.
Thus did I wind, and twine, and shrink, under the burden that was
upon me; which burden also did so oppress me, that I could neither
stand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.</p>
<p><a id="id166" href="#id166">166</a>. Yet that saying would sometimes come to my mind, He hath
received gifts for the rebellious (Ps. 68.18). 'The rebellious,'
thought I; why, surely they are such as once were under subjection
to their prince, even those who, after they have sworn subjection
to his government, have taken up arms against him; and this,
thought I, is my very condition; once I loved Him, feared Him,
served Him; but now I am a rebel; I have sold Him, I have said, Let
Him go if He will; but yet He has gifts for rebels, and then why
not for me?</p>
<p><a id="id167" href="#id167">167</a>. This sometimes I thought on, and should labour to take hold
thereof, that some, though small, refreshment might have been
conceived by me; but in this also I missed of my desire, I was
driven with force beyond it, I was like a man that is going to the
place of execution, even by that place where he would fain creep in
and hide himself, but may not.</p>
<p><a id="id168" href="#id168">168</a>. Again, after I had thus considered the sins of the saints
in particular, and found mine went beyond them, then I began to
think thus with myself: Set the case I should put all theirs
together, and mine alone against them, might I not then find some
encouragement? For if mine, though bigger than any one, yet should
but be equal to all, then there is hopes; for that blood that hath
virtue enough in it to wash away all theirs, hath also virtue
enough in it to do away mine, though this one be full as big, if no
bigger, than all theirs. Here, again, I should consider the sin of
David, of Solomon, of Manasseh, of Peter, and the rest of the great
offenders; and should also labour, what I might with fairness, to
aggravate and heighten their sins by several circumstances: but,
alas! it was all in vain.</p>
<p><a id="id169" href="#id169">169</a>. I should think with myself that David shed blood to cover
his adultery, and that by the sword of the children of Ammon; a
work that could not be done but by continuance and deliberate
contrivance, which was a great aggravation to his sin. But then
this would turn upon me: Ah! but these were but sins against the
law, from which there was a Jesus sent to save them; but yours is a
sin against the Saviour, and who shall save you from that?</p>
<p><a id="id170" href="#id170">170</a>. Then I thought on Solomon, and how he sinned in loving
strange women, in falling away to their idols, in building them
temples, in doing this after light, in his old age, after great
mercy received; but the same conclusion that cut me off in the
former consideration, cut me off as to this; namely, that all those
were but sins against the law, for which God had provided a remedy;
but I had sold my Saviour, and there now remained no more sacrifice
for sin.</p>
<p><a id="id171" href="#id171">171</a>. I would then add to those men's sins, the sins of Manasseh,
how that he built altars for idols in the house of the Lord; he
also observed times, used enchantments, had to do with wizards, was
a wizard, had his familiar spirits, burned his children in the fire
in sacrifice to devils, and made the streets of Jerusalem run down
with the blood of innocents. These, I thought, are great sins, sins
of a bloody colour; yea, it would turn again upon me: They are none
of them of the nature of yours; you have parted with Jesus, you
have sold your Saviour.</p>
<p><a id="id172" href="#id172">172</a>. This one consideration would always kill my heart, My sin
was point-blank against my Saviour; and that too, at that height,
that I had in my heart said of Him, Let Him go if He will. Oh!
methought, this sin was bigger than the sins of a country, of a
kingdom, or of the whole world, no one pardonable, nor all of them
together, was able to equal mine; mine outwent them every one.</p>
<p><a id="id173" href="#id173">173</a>. Now I should find my mind to flee from God, as from the
face of a dreadful judge; yet this was my torment, I could not
escape His hand: 'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God' (Heb. 10.31). But blessed be His grace, that
scripture, in these flying sins, would call as running after me, 'I
have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions; and, as a
cloud, thy sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee' (Isa.
44.22). This, I say, would come in upon my mind, when I was fleeing
from the face of God; for I did flee from His face, that is, my
mind and spirit fled before Him; by reason of His highness, I could
not endure; then would the text cry, 'Return unto me, for I have
redeemed thee.' Indeed, this would make me make a little stop, and,
as it were, look over my shoulder behind me, to see if I could
discern that the God of grace did follow me with a pardon in His
hand, but I could no sooner do that, but all would be clouded and
darkened again by that sentence, 'For you know how that afterward,
when he would have inherited the blessing, he found no place of
repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.' Wherefore I
could not return, but fled, though at sometimes it cried 'Return,
return', as if it did holloa after me. But I feared to close in
therewith, lest it should not come from God; for that other, as I
said was still sounding in my conscience, 'For you know how that
afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was
rejected', etc.</p>
<p><a id="id174" href="#id174">174</a>. Once as I was walking to and fro in a good man's shop,
bemoaning of myself in my sad and doleful state, afflicting myself
with self- abhorrence for this wicked and ungodly thought;
lamenting, also, this hard hap of mine, for that I should commit so
great a sin; greatly fearing I would not be pardoned; praying,
also, in my heart, that if this sin of mine did differ from that
against the Holy Ghost, the Lord would show it me. And being now
ready to sink with fear, suddenly there was, as if there had rushed
in at the window, the noise of wind upon me, but very pleasant, and
as if I heard a voice speaking, Didst ever refuse to be justified
by the blood of Christ? And withal my whole life and profession
past was, in a moment, opened to me, wherein I was made to see that
designedly I had not; so my heart answered groaningly, No. Then
fell, with power, that word of God upon me, 'See that ye refuse not
him that speaketh'(Heb. 12.25). This made a strange seizure upon my
spirit; it brought light with it, and commanded a silence in my
heart of all those tumultuous thoughts that before did use, like
masterless hell- hounds, to roar and bellow, and make a hideous
noise within me. It showed me, also, that Jesus Christ had yet a
word of grace and mercy for me, that He had not, as I had feared,
quite forsaken and cast off my soul; yea, this was a kind of chide
for my proneness to desperation; a kind of a threatening me if I
did not, notwithstanding my sins and the heinousness of them,
venture my salvation upon the Son of God. But as to my determining
about this strange dispensation, what it was I knew not; from
whence it came I knew not. I have not yet, in twenty years' time,
been able to make a judgment of it; I thought then what here I
shall be loath to speak. But verily, that sudden rushing wind was
as if an angel had come upon me; but both it and the salvation I
will leave until the day of judgment; only this I say, it commanded
a great calm in my soul, it persuaded me there might be hope; it
showed me, as I thought, what the sin unpardonable was, and that my
soul had yet the blessed privilege to flee to Jesus for mercy. But,
I say, concerning this dispensation, I know not what yet to say
unto it; which was, also, in truth, the cause that, at first, I did
not speak of it in the book; I do now, also, leave it to be thought
on by men of sound judgment. I lay not the stress of my salvation
thereupon, but upon the Lord Jesus, in the promise; yet, seeing I
am here unfolding of my secret things, I thought it might not be
altogether inexpedient to let this also show itself, though I
cannot now relate the matter as there I did experience it. This
lasted, in the savour of it, for about three or four days, and then
I began to mistrust and to despair again.</p>
<p><a id="id175" href="#id175">175</a>. Wherefore, still my life hung in doubt before me, not
knowing which way I should tip; only this I found my soul desire,
even to cast itself at the foot of grace, by prayer and
supplication. But, oh! it was hard for me now to bear the face to
pray to this Christ for mercy, against whom I had thus most vilely
sinned; it was hard work, I say, to offer to look Him in the face
against whom I had so vilely sinned; and, indeed, I have found it
as difficult to come to God by prayer, after backsliding from Him,
as to do any other thing. Oh, the shame that did now attend me!
especially when I thought I am now a-going to pray to Him for mercy
that I had so lightly esteemed but a while before! I was ashamed,
yea, even confounded, because this villainy had been committed by
me; but I saw there was but one way with me, I must go to Him and
humble myself unto Him, and beg that He, of His wonderful mercy,
would show pity to me, and have mercy upon my wretched sinful
soul.</p>
<p><a id="id176" href="#id176">176</a>. Which, when the tempter perceived, he strongly suggested to
me, That I ought not to pray to God; for prayer was not for any in
my case, neither could it do me good, because I had rejected the
Mediator, by whom all prayer came with acceptance to God the
Father, and without whom no prayer could come into His presence.
Wherefore, now to pray is but to add sin to sin; yea, now to pray,
seeing God has cast you off, is the next way to anger and offend
Him more than you ever did before.</p>
<p><a id="id177" href="#id177">177</a>. For God, saith he, hath been weary of you for these several
years already, because you are none of His; your bawlings in His
ears hath been no pleasant voice to Him; and, therefore, He let you
sin this sin, that you might be quite cut off; and will you pray
still? This the devil urged, and set forth that, in Numbers, when
Moses said to the children of Israel, That because they would not
go up to possess the land when God would have them, therefore, for
ever after, God did bar them out from thence, though they prayed
they might, with tears (Num. 14.36, 37, etc.).</p>
<p><a id="id178" href="#id178">178</a>. As it is said in another place (Exod. 21.14), the man that
sins presumptuously shall be taken from God's altar, that he may
die; even as Joab was by King Solomon, when he thought to find
shelter there (1 Kings 2.28, etc.). These places did pinch me very
sore; yet, my case being desperate, I thought with myself I can but
die; and if it must be so, it shall once be said, that such an one
died at the foot of Christ in prayer. This I did, but with great
difficulty, God doth know; and that because, together with this,
still that saying about Esau would be set at my heart, even like a
flaming sword, to keep the way of the tree of life, lest I should
taste thereof and live. Oh! who knows how hard a thing I found it
to come to God in prayer.</p>
<p><a id="id179" href="#id179">179</a>. I did also desire the prayers of the people of God for me,
but I feared that God would give them no heart to do it; yea, I
trembled in my soul to think that some or other of them would
shortly tell me, that God had said those words to them that He once
did say to the prophet concerning the children of Israel, 'Pray
thou not for this people,' for I have rejected them (Jer. 11.14).
So, pray not for him, for I have rejected him. Yea, I thought that
He had whispered this to some of them already, only they durst not
tell me so, neither durst I ask them of it, for fear, if it should
be so, it would make me quite beside myself. Man knows the
beginning of sin, said Spira, but who bounds the issues
thereof?</p>
<p><a id="id180" href="#id180">180</a>. About this time I took an opportunity to break my mind to
an ancient Christian, and told him all my case; I told him, also,
that I was afraid that I had sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost;
and he told me he thought so too. Here, therefore, I had but cold
comfort; but, talking a little more with him, I found him, though a
good man, a stranger to much combat with the devil. Wherefore, I
went to God again, as well as I could, for mercy still.</p>
<p><a id="id181" href="#id181">181</a>. Now, also, did the tempter begin to mock me in my misery,
saying, that, seeing I had thus parted with the Lord Jesus, and
provoked Him to displeasure, who would have stood between my soul
and the flame of devouring fire, there was now but one way, and
that was, to pray that God the Father would be the Mediator betwixt
His Son and me, that we might be reconciled again, and that I might
have that blessed benefit in Him that His blessed saints
enjoyed.</p>
<p><a id="id182" href="#id182">182</a>. Then did that scripture seize upon my soul, He is of one
mind, and who can turn Him? Oh! I saw it was as easy to persuade
Him to make a new world, a new covenant, or new Bible, besides that
we have already, as to pray for such a thing. This was to persuade
Him that what He had done already was mere folly, and persuade with
Him to alter, yea, to disannul, the whole way of salvation; and
then would that saying rend my soul asunder, 'Neither is there
salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven,
given among men, whereby we must be saved' (Acts 4.12).</p>
<p><a id="id183" href="#id183">183</a>. Now the most free, and full, and gracious words of the
gospel were the greatest torment to me; yea, nothing so afflicted
me as the thoughts of Jesus Christ, the remembrance of a Saviour;
because I had cast Him off, brought forth the villainy of my sin,
and my loss by it to mind; nothing did twinge my conscience like
this. Every time that I thought of the Lord Jesus, of His grace,
love, goodness, kindness, gentleness, meekness, death, blood,
promises and blessed exhortations, comforts and consolations, it
went to my soul like a sword; for still, unto these my
considerations of the Lord Jesus, these thoughts would make place
for themselves in my heart; aye, this is the Jesus, the loving
Saviour, the Son of God, whom thou hast parted with, whom you
slighted, despised, and abused. This is the only Saviour, the only
Redeemer, the only one that could so love sinners as to wash them
from their sins in His own most precious blood; but you have no
part nor lot in this Jesus, you have put Him away from you, you
have said in your heart, Let Him go if He will. Now, therefore, you
are severed from Him; you have severed yourself from Him. Behold,
then, His goodness, but you yourself be no partaker of it. Oh,
thought I, what have I lost! What have I parted with! What have I
disinherited my poor soul of! Oh! it is sad to be destroyed by the
grace and mercy of God; to have the Lamb, the Saviour, turn lion
and destroyer (Rev. 6). I also trembled, as I have said, at the
sight of the saints of God, especially at those that greatly loved
Him, and that made it their business to walk continually with Him
in this world; for they did, both in their words, their carriages,
and all their expressions of tenderness and fear to sin against
their precious Saviour, condemn, lay guilt upon, and also add
continual affliction and shame unto my soul. The dread of them was
upon me, and I trembled at God's Samuels (1 Sam. 16.4).</p>
<p><a id="id184" href="#id184">184</a>. Now, also, the tempter began afresh to mock my soul another
way, saying that Christ, indeed, did pity my case, and was sorry
for my loss; but forasmuch as I had sinned and transgressed, as I
had done, He could by no means help me, nor save me from what I
feared; for my sin was not of the nature of theirs for whom He bled
and died, neither was it counted with those that were laid to His
charge when He hanged on the tree. Therefore, unless He should come
down from heaven and die anew for this sin, though, indeed, He did
greatly pity me, yet I could have no benefit of Him. These things
may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in
themselves, but to me they were most tormenting cogitations; every
of them augmented my misery, that Jesus Christ should have so much
love as to pity me when He could not help me; nor did I think that
the reason why He could not help me was because His merits were
weak, or His grace and salvation spent on them already, but because
His faithfulness to His threatening would not let Him extend His
mercy to me. Besides, I thought, as I have already hinted, that my
sin was not within the bounds of that pardon that was wrapped up in
a promise; and if not, then I knew assuredly, that it was more easy
for heaven and earth to pass away than for me to have eternal life.
So that the ground of all these fears of mine did arise from a
steadfast belief that I had of the stability of the holy Word of
God, and, also, from my being misinformed of the nature of my
sin.</p>
<p><a id="id185" href="#id185">185</a>. But oh! how this would add to my affliction, to conceit
that I should be guilty of such a sin for which He did not die.
These thoughts would so confound me, and imprison me, and tie me up
from faith, that I knew not what to do; but, oh! I thought, that He
would come down again! Oh! that the work of man's redemption was
yet to be done by Christ! How would I pray Him and entreat Him to
count and reckon this sin amongst the rest for which He died! But
this scripture would strike me down as dead, 'Christ being raised
from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him'
(Rom. 6.9).</p>
<p><a id="id186" href="#id186">186</a>. Thus, by the strange and unusual assaults of the tempter,
was my soul, like a broken vessel, driven as with the winds, and
tossed sometimes headlong into despair, sometimes upon the covenant
of works, and sometimes to wish that the new covenant, and the
conditions thereof, might, so far forth as I thought myself
concerned, be turned another way and changed. But in all these I
was but as those that justle against the rocks; more broken,
scattered, and rent. Oh, the unthought of imaginations, frights,
fears, and terrors that are affected by a thorough application of
guilt, yielded to desperation! this is the man that hath 'his
dwelling among the tombs' with the dead; that is, always crying out
and 'cutting himself with stones' (Mark 5. 2-5). But I say, all in
vain; desperation will not comfort him, the old covenant will not
save him; nay, heaven and earth shall pass away before one jot or
tittle of the Word and law of grace shall fall or be removed. This
I saw, this I felt, and under this I groaned; yet this advantage I
got thereby, namely, a further confirmation of the certainty of the
way of salvation, and that the Scriptures were the Word of God! Oh!
I cannot now express what then I saw and felt of the steadiness of
Jesus Christ, the rock of man's salvation; what was done could not
be undone, added to, nor altered. I saw, indeed, that sin might
drive the soul beyond Christ, even the sin which is unpardonable;
but woe to him that was so driven, for the Word would shut him
out.</p>
<p><a id="id187" href="#id187">187</a>. Thus was I always sinking, whatever I did think or do. So
one day I walked to a neighbouring town, and sat down upon a settle
in the street, and fell into a very deep pause about the most
fearful state my sin had brought me to; and, after long musing, I
lifted up my head, but methought I saw as if the sun that shineth
in the heavens did grudge to give light, and as if the very stones
in the street, and tiles upon the houses, did bend themselves
against me; methought that they all combined together to banish me
out of the world; I was abhorred of them, and unfit to dwell among
them, or be partaker of their benefits, because I had sinned
against the Saviour. O how happy, now, was every creature over what
I was; for they stood fast and kept their station, but I was gone
and lost.</p>
<p><a id="id188" href="#id188">188</a>. Then breaking out in the bitterness of my soul, I said to
myself, with a grievous sigh, How can God comfort such a wretch as
I? I had no sooner said it but this returned upon me, as an echo
doth answer a voice, This sin is not unto death. At which I was as
if I had been raised out of a grave, and cried out again, Lord, how
couldest Thou find out such a word as this? for I was filled with
admiration at the fitness, and, also, at the unexpectedness of the
sentence, the fitness of the word, the rightness of the timing of
it, the power, and sweetness, and light, and glory that came with
it, was marvellous to me to find. I was now, for the time, out of
doubt as to that about which I so much was in doubt before; my
fears before were, that my sin was not pardonable, and so that I
had no right to pray, to repent, etc., or that if I did, it would
be of no advantage or profit to me. But now, thought I, if this sin
is not unto death, then it is pardonable; therefore, from this I
have encouragement to come to God, by Christ, for mercy, to
consider the promise of forgiveness as that which stands with open
arms to receive me, as well as others. This, therefore, was a great
easement to my mind; to wit, that my sin was pardonable, that it
was not the sin unto death (1 John 5.16, 17). None but those that
know what my trouble, by their own experience, was, can tell what
relief came to my soul by this consideration; it was a release to
me from my former bonds, and a shelter from my former storm. I
seemed now to stand upon the same ground with other sinners, and to
have as good right to the word and prayer as any of them.</p>
<p><a id="id189" href="#id189">189</a>. Now, I say, I was in hopes that my sin was not
unpardonable, but that there might be hopes for me to obtain
forgiveness. But oh, how Satan did now lay about him for to bring
me down again! But he could by no means do it, neither this day nor
the most part of the next, for this sentence stood like a mill-post
at my back; yet, towards the evening of the next day, I felt this
word begin to leave me and to withdraw its supportation from me,
and so I returned to my old fears again, but with a great deal of
grudging and peevishness, for I feared the sorrow of despair; nor
could my faith now longer retain this word.</p>
<p><a id="id190" href="#id190">190</a>. But the next day, at evening, being under many fears, I
went to seek the Lord; and as I prayed, I cried, and my soul cried
to Him in these words, with strong cries: O Lord, I beseech thee,
show me that thou hast loved me with everlasting love (Jer. 31.3).
I had no sooner said it but, with sweetness, this returned upon me,
as an echo or sounding again, 'I have loved thee with an
everlasting love.' Now I went to bed at quiet; also, when I awaked
the next morning, it was fresh upon my soul-and I believed it.</p>
<p><a id="id191" href="#id191">191</a>. But yet the tempter left me not; for it could not be so
little as an hundred times that he that day did labour to break my
peace. Oh! the combats and conflicts that I did then meet with as I
strove to hold by this word; that of Esau would fly in my face like
to lightning. I should be sometimes up and down twenty times in an
hour, yet God did bear me up and keep my heart upon this world,
from which I had also, for several days together, very much
sweetness and comfortable hopes of pardon; for thus it was made out
to me, I loved thee whilst thou wast committing this sin, I loved
thee before, I love thee still, and I will love thee for ever.</p>
<p><a id="id192" href="#id192">192</a>. Yet I saw my sin most barbarous, and a filthy crime, and
could not but conclude, and that with great shame and astonishment,
that I had horribly abused the holy Son of God; wherefore, I felt
my soul greatly to love and pity Him, and my bowels to yearn
towards Him; for I saw He was still my Friend, and did reward me
good for evil; yea, the love and affection that then did burn
within to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ did work, at this time,
such a strong and hot desire of revengement upon myself for the
abuse I had done unto him, that, to speak as I then thought, had I
a thousand gallons of blood within my veins, I could freely then
have spilt it all at the command and feet of this my Lord and
Saviour.</p>
<p><a id="id193" href="#id193">193</a>. And as I was thus in musing and in my studies, considering
how to love the Lord and to express my love to Him, that saying
came in upon me, 'If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, 0 Lord,
who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou
mayest be feared' (Ps. 130.3, 4). These were good words to me,
especially the latter part thereof; to wit, that there is
forgiveness with the Lord, that He might be feared; that is, as
then I understood it, that He might be loved and had in reverence;
for it was thus made out to me, that the great God did set so high
an esteem upon the love of His poor creatures, that rather than He
would go without their love He would pardon their
transgressions.</p>
<p><a id="id194" href="#id194">194</a>. And now was that word fulfilled on me, and I was also
refreshed by it, Then shall they be ashamed and confounded, 'and
never open their mouth any more because of their shame, when I am
pacified towards them for all that they have done, saith the Lord
God' (Ezek. 16.63). Thus was my soul at this time, and, as I then
did think, for ever, set at liberty from being again afflicted with
my former guilt and amazement.</p>
<p><a id="id195" href="#id195">195</a>. But before many weeks were over I began to despond again,
fearing lest, notwithstanding all that I had enjoyed, that yet I
might be deceived and destroyed at the last; for this consideration
came strong into my mind, that whatever comfort and peace I thought
I might have from the word of the promise of life, yet unless there
could be found in my refreshment a concurrence and agreement in the
Scriptures, let me think what I will thereof, and hold it never so
fast, I should find no such thing at the end; 'for the Scripture
cannot be broken' (John 10.35).</p>
<p><a id="id196" href="#id196">196</a>. Now began my heart again to ache and fear I might meet with
disappointment at the last, wherefore I began, with all
seriousness, to examine my former comfort, and to consider whether
one that had sinned as I have done, might with confidence trust
upon the faithfulness of God, laid down in those words by which I
had been comforted and on which I had leaned myself. But now were
brought those sayings to my mind, 'For it is impossible for those
who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift,
and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good
word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall
fall away, to renew them again unto repentance' (Heb. 6.4-6). 'For
if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the
truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain
fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall
devour the adversaries' (Heb. 10.26, 27). Even 'as Esau, who for
one morsel of meat sold his birthright; for ye know how that
afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was
rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it
carefully with tears' (Heb. 12.16, 17) .</p>
<p><a id="id197" href="#id197">197</a>. Now was the word of the gospel forced from my soul, so that
no promise or encouragement was to be found in the Bible for me;
and now would that saying work upon my spirit to afflict me,
'Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy as other people' (Hos. 9.1). For I
saw indeed there was cause of rejoicing for those that held to
Jesus; but as for me, I had cut myself off by my transgressions,
and left myself neither foot-hold, nor hand-hold, amongst all the
stays and props in the precious word of life.</p>
<p><a id="id198" href="#id198">198</a>. And truly I did now feel myself to sink into a gulf, as an
house whose foundation is destroyed; I did liken myself, in this
condition, unto the case of a child that was fallen into a
mill-pit, who, though it could make some shift to scrabble and
spraul in the water, yet because it could find neither hold for
hand nor foot, therefore at last it must die in that condition. So
soon as this fresh assault had fastened on my soul, that scripture
came into my heart, 'This is for many days' (Dan. 10.14). And
indeed I found it was so; for I could not be delivered, nor brought
to peace again, until well-nigh two years and an half were
completely finished. Wherefore these words, though in themselves
they tended to discouragement, yet to me, who feared this condition
would be eternal, they were at sometimes as an help and refreshment
to me.</p>
<p><a id="id199" href="#id199">199</a>. For, thought I, many days are not for ever, many days will
have an end, therefore seeing I was to be afflicted, not a few, but
many days, yet I was glad it was but for many days. Thus, I say, I
could recall myself sometimes, and give myself a help, for as soon
as ever the words came into my mind at first, I knew my trouble
would be long; yet this would be but sometimes, for I could not
always think on this, nor ever be helped by it, though I did.</p>
<p><a id="id200" href="#id200">200</a>. Now while these scriptures lay before me, and laid sin anew
at my door, that saying in the eighteeneth of Luke, with others,
did encourage me to prayer. Then the tempter again laid at me very
sore, suggesting, That neither the mercy of God, nor yet the blood
of Christ, did at all concern me, nor could they help me for my
sin; therefore it was in vain to pray. Yet, thought I, I will pray.
But, said the tempter, your sin is unpardonable. Well, said I, I
will pray. It is to no boot, said he. Yet, said I, I will pray. So
I went to prayer to God; and while I was at prayer, I uttered words
to this effect, Lord, Satan tells me that neither Thy mercy, nor
Christ's blood, is sufficient to save my soul; Lord, shall I honour
Thee most, by believing Thou wilt and canst? or him, by believing
Thou neither wilt nor canst? Lord, I would fain honour Thee, by
believing Thou wilt and canst.</p>
<p><a id="id201" href="#id201">201</a>. And as I was thus before the Lord, that scripture fastened
on my heart, 'O woman, great is thy faith' (Matt. 15.28), even as
if one had clapped me on the back, as I was on my knees before God.
Yet I was not able to believe this, that this was a prayer of
faith, till almost six months after; for I could not think that I
had faith, or that there should be a word for me to act faith on;
therefore I should still be as sticking in the jaws of desperation,
and went mourning up and down in a sad condition, crying, Is His
mercy clean gone? Is His mercy clean gone for ever? And I thought
sometimes, even when I was groaning in these expressions, they did
seem to make a question whether it was or no; yet I greatly feared
it was.</p>
<p><a id="id202" href="#id202">202</a>. There was nothing now that I longed for more than to be put
out of doubt, as to this thing in question; and, as I was
vehemently desiring to know if there was indeed hopes for me, these
words came rolling into my mind, 'Will the Lord cast off for ever?
and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for
ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be
gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?' (Ps.
77.7-9). And all the while they run in my mind, methought I had
this still as the answer, It is a question whether He had or no; it
may be He hath not. Yea, the interrogatory seemed to me to carry in
it a sure affirmation that indeed He had not, nor would so cast
off, but would be favourable; that His promise doth not fail, and
that He had not forgotten to be gracious, nor would in anger shut
up His tender mercy. Something, also, there was upon my heart at
the same time, which I now cannot call to mind; which, with this
text, did sweeten my heart, and made me conclude that His mercy
might not be quite gone, nor clean gone for ever.</p>
<p><a id="id203" href="#id203">203</a>. At another time, I remember I was again much under the
question, Whether the blood of Christ was sufficient to save my
soul? In which doubt I continued from morning till about seven or
eight at night: and at last, when I was, as it were, quite worn out
with fear, lest it should not lay hold on me, these words did sound
suddenly within my heart, He is able. But methought this word scaps
able was spoke so loud unto me; it showed such a great word, it
seemed to be writ in great letters, and gave such a justle to my
fear and doubt; I mean for the time it tarried with me, which was
about a day, as I never had from that all my life, either before or
after that (Heb. 7.25).</p>
<p><a id="id204" href="#id204">204</a>. But one morning, when I was again at prayer, and trembling
under the fear of this, that no word of God could help me, that
piece of a sentence darted in upon me, 'My grace is sufficient.' At
this methought I felt some stay, as if there might be hopes. But,
oh, how good a thing it is for God to send His word! For about a
fortnight before I was looking on this very place, and then I
thought it could not come near my soul with comfort, therefore I
threw down my book in a pet. Then I thought it was not large enough
for me; no, not large enough; but now, it was as if it had arms of
grace so wide that it could not only enclose me, but many more
besides.</p>
<p><a id="id205" href="#id205">205</a>. By these words I was sustained, yet not without exceeding
conflicts, for the space of seven or eight weeks; for my peace
would be in and out, sometimes twenty times a day; comfort now, and
trouble presently; peace now, and before I could go a furlong as
full of fear and guilt as ever heart could hold; and this was not
only now and then, but my whole seven weeks' experience; for this
about the sufficiency of grace, and that of Esau's parting with his
birthright, would be like a pair of scales within my mind,
sometimes one end would be uppermost, and sometimes again the
other; according to which would be my peace or trouble.</p>
<p><a id="id206" href="#id206">206</a>. Therefore I still did pray to God, that He would come in
with this scripture more fully on my heart; to wit, that He would
help me to apply the whole sentence, for as yet I could not: that
He gave, I gathered; but farther I could not go, for as yet it only
helped me to hope there might be mercy for me, 'My grace is
sufficient'; and though it came no farther, it answered my former
question; to wit, that there was hope; yet, because 'for thee' was
left out, I was not contented, but prayed to God for that also.
Wherefore, one day, as I was in a meeting of God's people, full of
sadness and terror, for my fears again were strong upon me; and as
I was now thinking my soul was never the better; but my case most
sad and fearful, these words did, with great power, suddenly break
in upon me, 'My grace is sufficient for thee, my grace is
sufficient for thee, my grace is sufficient for thee,' three times
together; and, oh! methought that every word was a mighty word unto
me; as my, and grace, and sufficient, and for thee; they were then,
and sometimes are still, far bigger than others be.</p>
<p><a id="id207" href="#id207">207</a>. At which time my understanding was so enlightened, that I
was as though I had seen the Lord Jesus look down from heaven
through the tiles upon me, and direct these words unto me. This
sent me mourning home, it broke my heart, and filled me full of
joy, and laid me low as the dust; only it stayed not long with me,
I mean in this glory and refreshing comfort, yet it continued with
me for several weeks, and did encourage me to hope. But so soon as
that powerful operation of it was taken off my heart, that other
about Esau returned upon me as before; so my soul did hang as in a
pair of scales again, sometimes up and sometimes down, now in
peace, and anon again in terror.</p>
<p><a id="id208" href="#id208">208</a>. Thus I went on for many weeks, sometimes comforted, and
sometimes tormented; and, especially at some times, my torment
would be very sore, for all those scriptures forenamed in the
Hebrews, would be set before me, as the only sentences that would
keep me out of heaven. Then, again, I should begin to repent that
ever that thought went through me, I should also think thus with
myself, Why, how many scriptures are there against me? There are
but three or four: and cannot God miss them, and save me for all of
them? Sometimes, again, I should think, Oh! if it were not for
these three or four words, now how I might be comforted? And I
could hardly forbear, at some times, but to wish them out of the
book.</p>
<p><a id="id209" href="#id209">209</a>. Then methought I should see as if both Peter, and Paul, and
John, and all the writers, did look with scorn upon me, and hold me
in derision; and as if they said unto me, All our words are truth,
one of as much force as another. It is not we that have cut you
off, but you have cast away yourself; there is none of our
sentences that you must take hold upon but these, and such as
these: 'It is impossible; there remains no more sacrifice for sin'
(Heb. 6). And 'it had been better for them not to have known' the
will of God, 'than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them' (II Pet. 2.21). 'For the
Scriptures cannot be broken.'</p>
<p><a id="id210" href="#id210">210</a>. These, as the elders of the city of refuge, I saw were to
be the judges both of my case and me, while I stood, with the
avenger of blood at my heels, trembling at their gate for
deliverance, also with a thousand fears and mistrusts, I doubted
that they would shut me out for ever (Josh. 20.3, 4).</p>
<p><a id="id211" href="#id211">211</a>. Thus was I confounded, not knowing what to do, nor how to
be satisfied in this question, Whether the scriptures could agree
in the salvation of my soul? I quaked at the apostles, I knew their
words were true, and that they must stand for ever.</p>
<p><a id="id212" href="#id212">212</a>. And I remember one day, as I was in diverse frames of
spirit, and considering that these frames were still according to
the nature of the several scriptures that came in upon my mind; if
this of grace, then was I quiet; but if that of Esau, then
tormented; Lord, thought I, if both these scriptures would meet in
my heart at once, I would which of them would get the better of me.
So methought I had a longing mind that they might come both
together upon me; yea, I desired of God they might.</p>
<p><a id="id213" href="#id213">213</a>. Well, about two or three days after, so they did indeed;
they bolted both upon me at a time, and did work and struggle
strangely in me for a while; at last, that about Esau's birthright
began to wax weak, and withdraw, and vanish and this about the
sufficiency of grace prevailed with peace and joy. And as I was in
a muse about this thing, that scripture came home upon me, 'Mercy
rejoiceth against judgment' (Jas. 2.13).</p>
<p><a id="id214" href="#id214">214</a>. This was a wonderment to me; yet truly I am apt to think it
was of God; for the word of the law and wrath must give place to
the word of life and grace; because, though the word of
condemnation be glorious, yet the word of life and salvation doth
far exceed in glory (II Cor. 3.8-12; Mark 9.5-7). Also, that Moses
and Elias must both vanish, and leave Christ and His saints
alone.</p>
<p><a id="id215" href="#id215">215</a>. This scripture did also most sweetly visit my soul, 'And
him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out' (John 6.37). Oh,
the comfort that I have had from this word, 'in no wise'! as who
should say, by no means, for no thing, whatever he hath done. But
Satan would greatly labour to pull this promise from me, telling of
me that Christ did not mean me, and such as I, but sinners of a
lower rank, that had not done as I had done. But I should answer
him again, Satan, here is in this word no such exception; but 'him
that comes', scaps him, any him; 'him that cometh to me I will in
no wise cast out.' And this I well remember still, that of all the
sleights that Satan used to take this scripture from me, yet he
never did so much as put this question, But do you come aright? And
I have thought the reason was, because he thought I knew full well
what coming aright was; for I saw that to come aright was to come
as I was, a vile and ungodly sinner, and to cast myself at the feet
of mercy, condemning myself for sin. If ever Satan and I did strive
for any word of God in all my life, it was for this good word of
Christ; he at one end and I at the other. Oh, what work did we
make! It was for this in John, I say, that we did so tug and
strive; he pulled and I pulled; but, God be praised, I got the
better of him, I got some sweetness from it.</p>
<p><a id="id216" href="#id216">216</a>. But notwithstanding all these helps and blessed words of
grace, yet that of Esau's selling of his birthright would still at
times distress my conscience; for though I had been most sweetly
comforted, and that but just before, yet when that came into my
mind, it would make me fear again, I could not be quite rid
thereof, it would every day be with me: wherefore now I went
another way to work, even to consider the nature of this
blasphemous thought; I mean, if I should take the words at the
largest, and give them their own natural force and scope, even
every word therein. So when I had thus considered, I found, that if
they were fairly taken, they would amount to this, that I had
freely left the Lord Jesus Christ to His choice, whether He would
be my Saviour or no; for the wicked words were these, Let Him go if
He will. Then that scripture gave me hope, 'I will never leave thee
nor forsake thee' (Heb. 13.5). O Lord, said I, but I have left
Thee. Then it answered again, 'But I will not leave thee.' For this
I thank God also.</p>
<p><a id="id217" href="#id217">217</a>. Yet I was grievously afraid He should, and found it
exceedingly hard to trust Him, seeing I had so offended Him. I
could have been exceeding glad that this thought had never
befallen, for then I thought I could, with more ease and freedom in
abundance, have leaned upon His grace. I see it was with me, as it
was with Joseph's brethren; the guilt of their own wickedness did
often fill them with fears that their brother would at last despise
them (Gen. 50.15-17).</p>
<p><a id="id218" href="#id218">218</a>. But above all the scriptures that I yet did meet with, that
in the twentieth of Joshua was the greatest comfort to me, which
speaks of the slayer that was to flee for refuge. And if the
avenger of blood pursue the slayer, then, saith Moses, they that
are the elders of the city of refuge shall not deliver him into his
hand, because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not
aforetime. Oh, blessed be God for this word; I was convinced that I
was the slayer; and that the avenger of blood pursued me, that I
felt with great terror; only now it remained that I inquire whether
I have right to enter the city of refuge. So I found that he must
not, who lay in wait to shed blood: it was not the wilful murderer,
but he who unwittingly did it, he who did unawares shed blood; not
of spite, or grudge, or malice, he that shed it unwittingly, even
he who did not hate his neighbour before. Wherefore:</p>
<p><a id="id219" href="#id219">219</a>. I thought verily I was the man that must enter, because I
had smitten my neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not aforetime.
I hated Him not aforetime; no, I prayed unto Him, was tender of
sinning against Him; yea, and against this wicked temptation I had
strove for a twelvemonth before; yea, and also when it did pass
through my heart, it did in spite of my teeth: wherefore I thought
I had right to enter this city, and the elders, which are the
apostles, were not to deliver me up. This, therefore, was great
comfort to me; and did give me much ground of hope.</p>
<p><a id="id220" href="#id220">220</a>. Yet being very critical, for my smart had made me that I
knew not what ground was sure enough to bear me, I had one question
that my soul did much desire to be resolved about; and that was,
Whether it be possible for any soul that hath indeed sinned the
unpardonable sin, yet after that to receive though but the least
true spiritual comfort from God through Christ? The which, after I
had much considered, I found the answer was, No, they could not,
and that for these reasons:</p>
<p><a id="id221" href="#id221">221</a>. First, Because those that have sinned that sin, they are
debarred a share in the blood of Christ, and being shut out of
that, they must needs be void of the least ground of hope. and so
of spiritual comfort; for to such 'there remaineth no more
sacrifice for sins' (Heb 10.26). Secondly, Because they are denied
a share in the promise of life; they shall never be forgiven,
'neither in this world, neither in that which is to come' (Matt.
12.32). Thirdly, The Son of God excludes them also from a share in
His blessed intercession, being for ever ashamed to own them both
before His holy Father, and the blessed angels in heaven (Mark
8.38).</p>
<p><a id="id222" href="#id222">222</a>. When I had, with much deliberation, considered of this
matter, and could not but conclude that the Lord had comforted me,
and that too after this my wicked sin; then, methought, I durst
venture to come nigh into those most fearful and terrible
scriptures, with which all this while I had been so greatly
affrighted, and on which, indeed, before I durst scarce cast mine
eye, yea, had much ado an hundred times to forbear wishing them out
of the Bible; for I thought they would destroy me; but now, I say,
I began to take some measure of encouragement to come close to
them, to read them, and consider them, and to weigh their scope and
tendency.</p>
<p><a id="id223" href="#id223">223</a>. The which, when I began to do, I found their visage
changed; for they looked not so grimly on me as before I thought
they did. And, first, I came to the sixth of the Hebrews, yet
trembling for fear it should strike me; which when I had
considered, I found that the falling there intended was a falling
quite away; that is, as I conceived, a falling from, and an
absolute denial of the gospel of remission of sins by Christ; for
from them the apostle begins his argument (ver. 1-3). Secondly, I
found that this falling away must be openly, even in the view of
the world, even so as 'to put Christ to an open shame'. Thirdly, I
found that those he there intended were for ever shut up of God,
both in blindness, hardness, and impenitency: it is impossible they
should be renewed again unto repentance. By all these particulars,
I found, to God's everlasting praise, my sin was not the sin in
this place intended.</p>
<p>First, I confessed I was fallen, but not fallen away, that is,
from the profession of faith in Jesus unto eternal life. Secondly,
I confessed that I had put Jesus Christ to shame by my sin, but not
to open shame; I did not deny Him before men, nor condemn Him as a
fruitless one before the world. Thirdly, Nor did I find that God
had shut me up, or denied me to come, though I found it hard work
indeed to come to Him by sorrow and repentance. Blessed be God for
unsearchable grace.</p>
<p><a id="id224" href="#id224">224</a>. Then I considered that in the tenth of the Hebrews, and
found that the wilful sin there mentioned is not every wilful sin,
but that which doth throw off Christ, and then His commandments
too. Secondly, That must also be done openly, before two or three
witnesses, to answer that of the law ( ver. 28). Thirdly, This sin
cannot be committed, but with great despite done to the Spirit of
grace; despising both the dissuasions from that sin, and the
persuasions to the contrary. But the Lord knows, though this my sin
was devilish, yet it did not amount to these.</p>
<p><a id="id225" href="#id225">225</a>. And as touching that in the twelfth of the Hebrews, about
Esau's selling his birthright, though this was that which killed
me, and stood like a spear against me; yet now I did consider,
First, That his was not a hasty thought against the continual
labour of his mind, but a thought consented to and put in practice
likewise, and that too after some deliberation (Gen. 25). Secondly,
it was a public and open action, even before his brother, if not
before many more; this made his sin of a far more heinous nature
than otherwise it would have been. Thirdly, He continued to slight
his birthright: 'He did eat and drink, and went his way; thus Esau
despised his birthright' (ver. 34). Yea, twenty years after, he was
found to despise it still. 'And Esau said, I have enough, my
brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself' (Gen. 33.9).</p>
<p><a id="id226" href="#id226">226</a>. Now as touching this, that Esau sought a place of
repentance; thus I thought, first, This was not for the birthright,
but for the blessing; this is clear from the apostle, and is
distinguished by Esau himself; 'He took away my birthright (that
is, formerly); and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing'
(Gen. 27.36). Secondly, Now, this being thus considered, I came
again to the apostle, to see what might be the mind of God, in a
New Testament style and sense, concerning Esau's sin; and so far as
I could conceive, this was the mind of God, that the birthright
signified regeneration, and the blessing the eternal inheritance;
for so the apostle seems to hint, 'Lest there be any profane
person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright';
as if he should say, Lest there be any person amongst you that
shall cast off all those blessed beginnings of God that at present
are upon him, in order to a new birth, lest they become as Esau,
even be rejected afterwards, when they would inherit the
blessing.</p>
<p><a id="id227" href="#id227">227</a>. For many there are who, in the day of grace and mercy,
despise those things which are indeed the birthright to heaven, who
yet, when the deciding day appears, will cry as loud as Esau,
'Lord, Lord, open to us'; but then, as Isaac would not repent, no
more will God the Father, but will say, I have blessed these, yea,
and they shall be blessed; but as for you, depart from me, all ye
workers of iniquity (Gen. 27.33; Luke 13.25-27).</p>
<p><a id="id228" href="#id228">228</a>. When I had thus considered these scriptures, and found that
thus to understand them was not against, but according to other
scriptures; this still added further to my encouragement and
comfort, and also gave a great blow to that objection, to wit, that
the scripture could not agree in the salvation of my soul. And now
remained only the hinder part of the tempest, for the thunder was
gone beyond me, only some drops did still remain, that now and then
would fall upon me; but because my former frights and anguish were
very sore and deep, therefore it did oft befal me still, as it
befalleth those that have been scared with fire, I thought every
voice was Fire, fire; every little touch would hurt my tender
conscience.</p>
<p><a id="id229" href="#id229">229</a>. But one day, as I was passing in the field, and that too
with some dashes on my conscience, fearing lest yet all was not
right, suddenly this sentence fell upon my soul, Thy righteousness
is in heaven; and methought withal, I saw, with the eyes of my
soul, Jesus Christ at God's right hand; there, I say, is my
righteousness; so that wherever I was, or whatever I was a-doing,
God could not say of me, He wants my righteousness, for that was
just before Him. I also saw, moreover, that it was not my good
frame of heart that made my righteousness better, nor yet my bad
frame that made my righteousness worse; for my righteousness was
Jesus Christ Himself, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever
(Heb. 13.8).</p>
<p><a id="id230" href="#id230">230</a>. Now did my chains fall off my legs indeed, I was loosed
from my affliction and irons, my temptations had fled away; so
that, from that time, those dreadful scriptures of God left off to
trouble me now; now went I also home rejoicing, for the grace and
love of God. So when I came home, I looked to see if I could find
that sentence, Thy righteousness is in heaven; but could not find
such a saying, wherefore my heart began to sink again, only that
was brought to my remembrance, He 'of God is made unto us wisdom,
and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption' by this word
I saw the other sentence true (1 Cor. 1.30).</p>
<p><a id="id231" href="#id231">231</a>. For by this scripture, l saw that the man Christ Jesus, as
He is distinct from us, as touching His bodily presence, so He is
our righteousness and sanctification before God. Here, therefore, I
lived for some time, very sweetly at peace with God through Christ;
Oh, methought, Christ! Christ! there was nothing but Christ that
was before my eyes, I was not only for looking upon this and the
other benefits of Christ apart, as of His blood, burial, or
resurrection, but considered Him as a whole Christ! As He in whom
all these, and all other His virtues, relations, offices, and
operations met together, and that as He sat on the right hand of
God in heaven.</p>
<p><a id="id232" href="#id232">232</a>. It was glorious to me to see His exaltation, and the worth
and prevalency of all His benefits, and that because of this: now I
could look from myself to Him, and should reckon that all those
graces of God that now were green in me, were yet but like those
cracked groats and fourpence-halfpennies that rich men carry in
their purses, when their gold is in their trunks at home! Oh, I saw
my gold was in my trunk at home! In Christ, my Lord and Saviour!
Now Christ was all; all my wisdom, all my righteousness, all my
sanctification, and all my redemption.</p>
<p><a id="id233" href="#id233">233</a>. Further, the Lord did also lead me into the mystery of
union with the Son of God, that I was joined to Him, that I was
flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bone, and now was that a sweet
word to me in Eph. 5.30. By this also was my faith in Him, as my
righteousness, the more confirmed to me; for if He and I were one,
then His righteousness was mine, His merits mine, His victory also
mine. Now could I see myself in heaven and earth at once; in heaven
by my Christ, by my head, by my righteousness and life, though on
earth by my body or person.</p>
<p><a id="id234" href="#id234">234</a>. Now I saw Christ Jesus was looked on of God, and should
also be looked on by us, as that common or public person, in whom
all the whole body of His elect are always to be considered and
reckoned; that we fulfilled the law by Him, rose from the dead by
Him, got the victory over sin, death, the devil, and hell, by Him;
when He died, we died; and so of His resurrection. 'Thy dead men
shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise,' saith he
(Isa. 26.19). And again, 'After two days will he revive us: in the
third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight'
(Hos. 6.2); which is now fulfilled by the sitting down of the Son
of Man on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, according
to that to the Ephesians, He 'hath raised us up together, and made
us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus' (Eph. 2.6).</p>
<p><a id="id235" href="#id235">235</a>. Ah, these blessed considerations and scriptures, with many
others of a like nature, were in those days made to spangle in mine
eyes, so that I have cause to say, 'Praise ye the Lord. Praise God
in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise
him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent
greatness' (Ps. 150.1, 2).</p>
<p><a id="id236" href="#id236">236</a>. Having thus, in few words, given you a taste of the sorrow
and affliction that my soul went under, by the guilt and terror
that this my wicked thought did lay me under; and having given you
also a touch of my deliverance therefrom, and of the sweet and
blessed comfort that I met with afterwards, which comfort dwelt
about a twelvemonth with my heart, to my unspeakable admiration; I
will now, God willing, before I proceed any farther, give you in a
word or two, what, as I conceive, was the cause of this temptation;
and also after that, what advantage, at the last, it became unto my
soul.</p>
<p><a id="id237" href="#id237">237</a>. For the causes, I conceived they were principally two: of
which two I also was deeply convinced all the time this trouble lay
upon me. The first was, for that I did not, when I was delivered
from the temptation that went before, still pray to God to keep me
from temptations that were to come; for though, as I can say in
truth, my soul was much in prayer before this trial seized me, yet
then I prayed only, or at the most, principally for the removal of
present troubles, and for fresh discoveries of His love in Christ,
which I saw afterwards was not enough to do; I also should have
prayed that the great God would keep me from the evil that was to
come.</p>
<p><a id="id238" href="#id238">238</a>. Of this I was made deeply sensible by the prayer of holy
David, who, when he was under present mercy, yet prayed that God
would hold him back from sin and temptation to come; 'Then,' saith
he, 'shall I be upright, I shall be innocent from the scaps great
transgression' (Ps. 19.13). By this very word was I galled and
condemned, quite through this long temptation.</p>
<p><a id="id239" href="#id239">239</a>. That also was another word that did much condemn me for my
folly, in the neglect of this duty (Heb 4.16), 'Let us therefore
come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need.' This I had not done, and
therefore was suffered thus to sin and fall, according to what is
written, 'Pray that ye enter not into temptation.' And truly this
very thing is to this day of such weight and awe upon me, that I
dare not, when I come before the Lord, go off my knees, until I
entreat Him for help and mercy against the temptations that are to
come; and I do beseech thee, reader, that thou learn to beware of
my negligence, by the affliction that for this thing I did for
days, and months, and years, with sorrow undergo.</p>
<p><a id="id240" href="#id240">240</a>. Another cause of this temptation was, that I had tempted
God; and on this manner did I do it. Upon a time my wife was great
with child, and before her full time was come, her pangs, as of a
woman in travail, were fierce and strong upon her, even as if she
would have immediately fallen in labour, and been delivered of an
untimely birth. Now, at this very time it was that I had been so
strongly tempted to question the being of God, wherefore, as my
wife lay crying by me, I said, but with all secrecy imaginable,
even thinking in my heart, Lord, if thou wilt now remove this sad
affliction from my wife, and cause that she be troubled no more
therewith this night, and now were her pangs just upon her, then I
shall know that thou canst discern the most secret thoughts of the
heart.</p>
<p><a id="id241" href="#id241">241</a>. I had no sooner said it in my heart, but her pangs were
taken from her, and she was cast into a deep sleep, and so she
continued till morning; at this I greatly marvelled, not knowing
what to think; but after I had been awake a good while, and heard
her cry no more, I fell to sleeping also. So when I waked in the
morning, it came upon me again, even what I had said in my heart
the last night, and how the Lord had showed me that He knew my
secret thoughts, which was a great astonishment unto me for several
weeks after.</p>
<p><a id="id242" href="#id242">242</a>. Well, about a year and a half afterwards, that wicked
sinful thought, of which I have spoken before, went through my
wicked heart, even this thought, Let Christ go if He will; so when
I was fallen under guilt for this, the remembrance of my other
thought, and of the effect thereof, would also come upon me with
this retort, which also carried rebuke along with it, Now you may
see that God doth know the most secret thoughts of the heart.</p>
<p><a id="id243" href="#id243">243</a>. And with this, that of the passages that were betwixt the
Lord and His servant Gideon fell upon my spirit; how because that
Gideon tempted God with his fleece, both wet and dry, when he
should have believed and ventured upon his words, therefore the
Lord did afterwards so try him, as to send him against an
innumerable company of enemies; and that too, as to outward
appearance, without any strength or help (Judg. 6, 7). Thus He
served me, and that justly, for I should have believed His word,
and not have put an scaps if upon the all-seeingness of God.</p>
<p><a id="id244" href="#id244">244</a>. And now to show you something of the advantages that I also
gained by this temptation; and first, By this I was made
continually to possess in my soul a very wonderful sense both of
the being and glory of God, and of His beloved Son; in the
temptation that went before, my soul was perplexed with unbelief,
blasphemy, hardness of heart, questions about the being of God,
Christ, the truth of the Word, and certainty of the world to come;
I say, then I was greatly assaulted and tormented with atheism; but
now the case was otherwise, now was God and Christ continually
before my face, though not in a way of comfort, but in a way of
exceeding dread and terror. The glory of the holiness of God did at
this time break me to pieces; and the bowels and compassion of
Christ did break me as on the wheel; for I could not consider Him
but as a lost and rejected Christ, the remembrance of which was as
the continual breaking of my bones.</p>
<p><a id="id245" href="#id245">245</a>. The Scriptures now also were wonderful things unto me; I
saw that the truth and verity of them were the keys of the kingdom
of heaven; those that the Scriptures favour they must inherit
bliss, but those that they oppose and condemn must perish evermore.
Oh! this word, 'For the Scriptures cannot be broken,' would rend
the caul of my heart; and so would that other, 'Whose soever sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye
retain, they are retained.' Now I saw the apostles to be the elders
of the city of refuge (Josh. 20.4), those that they were to receive
in, were received to life; but those that they shut out were to be
slain by the avenger of blood.</p>
<p><a id="id246" href="#id246">246</a>. Oh! one sentence of the Scripture did more afflict and
terrify my mind, I mean those sentences that stood against me, as
sometimes I thought they every one did, more, I say, than an army
of forty thousand men that might have come against me. Woe be to
him against whom the Scriptures bend themselves.</p>
<p><a id="id247" href="#id247">247</a>. By this temptation I was made to see more into the nature
of the promises than ever I was before; for I lying now trembling
under the mighty hand of God, continually torn and rent by the
thunderings of His justice; this made me, with careful heart and
watchful eye, with great seriousness, to turn over every leaf, and
with much diligence, mixed with trembling, to consider every
sentence, together with its natural force and latitude.</p>
<p><a id="id248" href="#id248">248</a>. By this temptation, also, I was greatly beaten off my
former foolish practice, of putting by the word of promise when it
came into my mind; for now, though I could not suck that comfort
and sweetness from the promise as I had done at other times, yea,
like to a man a-sinking, I should catch at all I saw; formerly I
thought I might not meddle with the promise unless I felt its
comfort, but now it was no time thus to do, the avenger of blood
too hardly did pursue me.</p>
<p><a id="id249" href="#id249">249</a>. Now therefore I was glad to catch at that word, which yet I
feared I had no ground or right to own; and even to leap into the
bosom of that promise, that yet I feared did shut its heart against
me. Now also I should labour to take the Word as God had laid it
down, without restraining the natural force of one syllable
thereof. O what did I now see in that blessed sixth of John, 'And
him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out' (ver. 37). Now I
began to consider with myself, that God had a bigger mouth to speak
with than I had heart to conceive with. I thought also with myself
that He spake not His words in haste, or in unadvised heat, but
with infinite wisdom and judgment, and in very truth and
faithfulness.</p>
<p><a id="id250" href="#id250">250</a>. I should in these days, often in my greatest agonies, even
flounce towards the promise, as the horses do towards sound ground
that yet stick in the mire, concluding, though as one almost bereft
of his wits through fear, on this I will rest and stay, and leave
the fulfilling of it to the God of heaven that made it. Oh! many a
pull hath my heart had with Satan for that sixth of John. I did not
now, as at other times, look principally for comfort, though, O how
welcome would it have been unto me! But now a word, a word to lean
a weary soul upon, that I might not sink for ever! it was that I
hunted for.</p>
<p><a id="id251" href="#id251">251</a>. Yea, often when I have been making to the promise, I have
seen as if the Lord would refuse my soul for ever. I was often as
if I had run upon the pikes, and as if the Lord had thrust at me to
keep me from Him as with a flaming sword. Then I should think of
Esther, who went to petition the king contrary to the law (Esth
4.16). I thought also of Benhadad's servants, who went with ropes
upon their heads to their enemies for mercy (1 Kings 20.31). The
woman of Canaan also, that would not be daunted, though called dog
by Christ (Matt. 15.21-8); and the man that went to borrow bread at
midnight (Luke 11.5-8), were great encouragements unto me.</p>
<p><a id="id252" href="#id252">252</a>. I never saw those heights and depths in grace, and love,
and mercy, as I saw after this temptation. Great sins to draw out
great grace; and where guilt is most terrible and fierce there the
mercy of God in Christ, when showed to the soul, appears most high
and mighty. When Job had passed through his captivity, he had
'twice as much as he had before' (Job 42.10). Blessed be God for
Jesus Christ our Lord. Many other things I might here make
observation of, but I would be brief, and therefore shall at this
time omit them, and do pray God that my harms may make others fear
to offend, lest they also be made to bear the iron yoke as I
did.</p>
<p>I had two or three times, at or about my deliverance from this
temptation, such strange apprehensions of the grace of God, that I
could hardly bear up under it, it was so out of measure amazing,
when I thought it could reach me, that I do think, if that sense of
it had abode long upon me, it would have made me incapable for
business.</p>
<p><a id="id253" href="#id253">253</a>. Now I shall go forward to give you a relation of other of
the Lord's leadings with me, of His dealings with me at sundry
other seasons, and of the temptations I then did meet withal. I
shall begin with what I met when I first did join in fellowship
with the people of God in Bedford. After I had propounded to the
church that my desire was to walk in the order and ordinances of
Christ with them, and was also admitted by them; while I thought of
that blessed ordinance of Christ, which was His last supper with
His disciples before His death, that scripture, 'This do in
remembrance of me' (Luke 22.19), was made a very precious word unto
me; for by it the Lord did come down upon my conscience with the
discovery of His death for my sins; and as I then felt, did as if
He plunged me in the virtue of the same. But, behold, I had not
been long a partaker at that ordinance, but such fierce and sad
temptations did attend me at all times therein, both to blaspheme
the ordinance, and to wish some deadly thing to those that then did
eat thereof; that, lest I should at any time be guilty of
consenting to these wicked and fearful thoughts, I was forced to
bend myself all the while to pray to God to keep me from such
blasphemies; and also to cry to God to bless the bread and cup to
them as it went from mouth to mouth. The reason of this temptation
I have thought since was, because I did not, with that reverence as
became me, at first approach to partake thereof.</p>
<p><a id="id254" href="#id254">254</a>. Thus I continued for three-quarters of a year, and could
never have rest nor ease; but at last the Lord came in upon my soul
with that same scripture by which my soul was visited before; and
after that I have been usually very well and comfortable in the
partaking of that blessed ordinance, and have, I trust, therein
discerned the Lord's body as broken for my sins, and that His
precious blood hath been shed for my transgressions.</p>
<p><a id="id255" href="#id255">255</a>. Upon a time I was somewhat inclining to a consumption,
wherewith, about the spring, I was suddenly and violently seized
with much weakness in my outward man, insomuch that I thought I
could not live. Now began I afresh to give myself up to a serious
examination after my state and condition for the future, and of my
evidences for that blessed world to come; for it hath, I bless the
name of God, been my usual course, as always, so especially in the
day of affliction, to endeavour to keep my interest in the life to
come clear before my eye.</p>
<p><a id="id256" href="#id256">256</a>. But I had no sooner began to recall to mind my former
experience of the goodness of God to my soul, but there came
flocking into my mind an innumerable company of my sins and
transgressions, amongst which these were at this time most to my
affliction, namely, my deadness, dulness, and coldness in holy
duties; my wanderings of heart, of my wearisomeness in all good
things, my want of love to God, His ways, and people, with this at
the end of all, Are these the fruits of Christianity? are these the
tokens of a blessed man?</p>
<p><a id="id257" href="#id257">257</a>. At the apprehension of these things my sickness was doubled
upon me, for now was I sick in my inward man, my soul was clogged
with guilt; now also was my former experience of God's goodness to
me quite taken out of my mind, and hid as if it had never been, nor
seen. Now was my soul greatly pinched between these two
considerations. Live I must not, Die I dare not; now I sunk and
fell in my spirit; and was giving up all for lost; but as I was
walking up and down in the house, as a man in a most woeful state,
that word of God took hold of my heart, Ye are 'justified freely by
his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus' (Rom.
3.24). But oh, what a turn it made upon me!</p>
<p><a id="id258" href="#id258">258</a>. Now was I as one awakened out of some troublesome sleep and
dream, and listening to this heavenly sentence, I was as if I had
heard it thus expounded to me: Sinner, thou thinkest that because
of thy sins and infirmities I cannot save thy soul, but behold My
Son is by Me, and upon Him I look, and not on thee, and will deal
with thee according as I am pleased with Him. At this I was greatly
lightened in my mind, and made to understand that God could justify
a sinner at any time; it was but His looking upon Christ, and
imputing of His benefits to us, and the work was forthwith
done.</p>
<p><a id="id259" href="#id259">259</a>. And as I was thus in a muse, that scripture also came with
great power upon my spirit, 'Not by works of righteousness which we
have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,' etc. (Tit. 3.5;
II Tim. 1.9). Now was I got on high; I saw myself within the arms
of grace and mercy; and though I was before afraid to think of a
dying hour, yet now I cried, Let me die. Now death was lovely and
beautiful in my sight; for I saw we shall never live indeed till we
be gone to the other world. Oh, methought this life is but a
slumber in comparison of that above; at this time also I saw more
in those words, 'Heirs of God' (Rom. 8.17), than ever I shall be
able to express while I live in this world. 'Heirs of God'! God
Himself is the portion of the saints. This I saw and wondered at,
but cannot tell you what I saw.</p>
<p><a id="id260" href="#id260">260</a>. Again, as I was at another time very ill and weak, all that
time also the tempter did beset me strongly, for I find he is much
for assaulting the soul when it begins to approach towards the
grave, then is his opportunity, labouring to hide from me my former
experience of God's goodness; also setting before me the terrors of
death and the judgment of God, insomuch that at this time, through
my fear of miscarrying for ever, should I now die, I was as one
dead before death came, and was as if I had felt myself already
descending into the pit; methought, I said, there was no way, but
to hell I must; but behold, just as I was in the midst of those
fears, these words of the angels carrying Lazarus into Abraham's
bosom darted in upon me, as who should say, So it shall be with
thee when thou dost leave this world. This did sweetly revive my
spirit, and help me to hope in God; which, when I had with comfort
mused on a while, that word fell with great weight upon my mind, 'O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?' (1 Cor.
15.55). At this I became both well in body and mind at once, for my
sickness did presently vanish, and I walked comfortably in my work
for God again.</p>
<p><a id="id261" href="#id261">261</a>. At another time, though just before I was pretty well and
savoury in my spirit, yet suddenly there fell upon me a great cloud
of darkness, which did so hide from me the things of God and
Christ, that I was as if I had never seen or known them in my life;
was also so overrun in my soul, with a senseless, heartless frame
of spirit, that I could not feel my soul to move or stir after
grace and life by Christ; I was as if my loins were broken, or as
if my hands and feet had been tied or bound with chains. At this
time also I felt some weakness to seize upon my outward man, which
made still the other affliction the more heavy and uncomfortable to
me.</p>
<p><a id="id262" href="#id262">262</a>. After I had been in this condition some three or four days,
as I was sitting by the fire, I suddenly felt this word to sound in
my heart, I must go to Jesus; at this my former darkness and
atheism fled away, and the blessed things of heaven were set within
my view. While I was on this sudden thus overtaken with surprise,
Wife, said I, is there ever such a scripture, I must go to Jesus?
She said she could not tell, therefore I sat musing still to see if
I could remember such a place; I had not sat above two or three
minutes but that came bolting in upon me, 'And to an innumerable
company of angels,' and withal, Hebrews the twelfth, about the
mount Sion, was set before mine eyes (ver. 22-4).</p>
<p><a id="id263" href="#id263">263</a>. Then with joy I told my wife, O now I know, I know! But
that night was a good night to me, I never had but few better; I
longed for the company of some of God's people that I might have
imparted unto them what God had showed me. Christ was a precious
Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy,
and peace, and triumph, through Christ; this great glory did not
continue upon me until morning, yet that twelfth of the author of
(Hebrews 12:22-4) was a blessed scripture to me for many days
together after this.</p>
<p><a id="id264" href="#id264">264</a>. The words are these, 'Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church
of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge
of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus
the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling,
that speaketh better things than that of Abel.' Through this
blessed sentence the Lord led me over and over, first to this word,
and then to that, and showed me wonderful glory in every one of
them. These words also have oft since this time been great
refreshment to my spirit. Blessed be God in having mercy on me.</p>
