<h2>A Relation of my Imprisonment in the Month of November 1660</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, by the good hand of my God, I
had for five or six years together, without any interruption,
freely preached the blessed gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; and
had also, through His blessed grace, some encouragement by His
blessing thereupon; the devil, that old enemy of man&rsquo;s
salvation, took his opportunity to inflame the hearts of his
vassals against me, insomuch that at the last, I was laid out for
by the warrant of a justice, and was taken and committed to
prison.&nbsp; The relation thereof is as followeth:&mdash;</p>
<p>Upon the 12th of this instant, November 1660, I was desired by
some of the friends in the country to come to teach at
<i>Samsell</i>, by <i>Harlington</i>, in
<i>Bedfordshire</i>.&nbsp; To whom I made a promise, if the Lord
permitted, to be with them on the time aforesaid.&nbsp; The
justice hearing thereof (whose name is Mr <i>Francis
Wingate</i>), forthwith issued out his warrant to take me, and
bring me before him, and in the meantime to keep a very strong
watch about the house where the meeting should be kept, as if we
that were to meet together in that place did intend to do some
fearful business, to the destruction of the country; when alas!
the constable, when he came in, found us only with our Bibles in
our hands, ready to speak and hear the word of God; for we were
just about to begin our exercise.&nbsp; Nay, we had begun in
prayer for the blessing of God upon our opportunity, intending to
have preached the word of the Lord unto them there present: <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a> but the constable coming in prevented
us.&nbsp; So I was taken and forced to depart the room.&nbsp; But
had I been minded to have played the coward, I could have escaped
and kept out of his hands.&nbsp; For when I was come to my
friend&rsquo;s house, there was whispering that that day I should
be taken, for there was a warrant out to take me; which when my
friend heard, he being somewhat timorous, questioned whether we
had best have our meeting or not; and whether it might not be
better for me to depart, lest they should take me and have me
before the justice, and after that send me to prison (for he knew
better than I what spirit they were of, living by them): to whom
I said, No, by no means, I will not stir, neither will I have the
meeting dismissed for this.&nbsp; Come, be of good cheer; let us
not be daunted; our cause is good, we need not be ashamed of it;
to preach God&rsquo;s Word, is so good a work, that we shall be
well rewarded, if we suffer for that; or to this
purpose&mdash;(But as for my friend, I think he was more afraid
of me, than of himself.)&nbsp; After this I walked into the
close, where I somewhat seriously considering the matter, this
came into my mind, That I had showed myself hearty and courageous
in my preaching, and had, blessed be grace, made it my business
to encourage others; therefore thought I, if I should now run,
and make an escape, it will be of a very ill savour in the
country.&nbsp; For what will my weak and newly-converted brethren
think of it, but that I was not so strong in deed as I was in
word?&nbsp; Also I feared that if I should run now there was a
warrant out for me, I might by so doing make them afraid to
stand, when great words only should be spoken to them.&nbsp;
Besides I thought, that seeing God of His mercy should choose me
to go upon the forlorn hope in this country; that is, to be the
first, that should be opposed, for the gospel; if I should fly,
it might be a discouragement to the whole body that might follow
after.&nbsp; And further, I thought the world thereby would take
occasion at my cowardliness, to have blasphemed the gospel, and
to have had some ground to suspect worse of me and my profession,
than I deserved.&nbsp; These things with others considered by me,
I came in again to the house, with a full resolution to keep the
meeting, and not to go away, though I could have been gone about
an hour before the officer apprehended me; but I would not; for I
was resolved to see the utmost of what they could say or do unto
me.&nbsp; For blessed be the Lord, I knew of no evil that I had
said or done.&nbsp; And so, as aforesaid, I begun the
meeting.&nbsp; But being prevented by the constable&rsquo;s
coming in with his warrant to take me, I could not proceed.&nbsp;
But before I went away, I spake some few words of counsel and
encouragement to the people, declaring to them, that they saw we
were prevented of our opportunity to speak and hear the Word of
God, and were like to suffer for the same; desiring them that
they would not be discouraged, for it was a mercy to suffer upon
so good account.&nbsp; For we might have been apprehended as
thieves or murderers, or for other wickedness; but blessed be God
it was not so, but we suffer as Christians for well doing: and we
had better be the persecuted, than the persecutors, etc.&nbsp;
But the constable and the justice&rsquo;s man waiting on us,
would not be at quiet till they had me away and that we departed
the house.&nbsp; But because the justice was not at home that
day, there was a friend of mine engaged for me to bring me to the
constable on the morrow morning.&nbsp; Otherwise the constable
must have charged a watch with me, or have secured me some other
way, my crime was so great.&nbsp; So on the next morning we went
to the constable, and so to the justice. <a
name="citation187a"></a><a href="#footnote187a"
class="citation">[187a]</a>&nbsp; He asked the constable what we
did, where we was met together, and what we had with us?&nbsp; I
trow, he meant whether we had armour or not; but when the
constable told him that there were only met a few of us together
to preach and hear the Word, and no sign of anything else, he
could not well tell what to say: yet because he had sent for me,
he did adventure to put out a few proposals to me, which were to
this effect, namely, What I did there?&nbsp; And why I did not
content myself with following my calling? for it was against the
law, that such as I should be admitted to do as I did.</p>
<p><i>John Bunyan</i>.&nbsp; To which I answered, That the intent
of my coming thither, and to other places, was to instruct, and
counsel people to forsake their sins, and close in with Christ,
lest they did miserably perish; and that I could do both these
without confusion (to wit), follow my calling, and preach the
Word also.</p>
<p>At which words, he <a name="citation187b"></a><a
href="#footnote187b" class="citation">[187b]</a> was in a chafe,
as it appeared; for he said that he would break the neck of our
meetings.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, It may be so.&nbsp; Then he wished
me to get sureties to be bound for me, or else he would send me
to the jail.</p>
<p>My sureties being ready, I called them in, and when the bond
for my appearance was made, he told them, that they was bound to
keep me from preaching; and that if I did preach, their bonds
would be forfeited.&nbsp; To which I answered, that then I should
break them; for I should not leave speaking the Word of God: even
to counsel, comfort, exhort, and teach the people among whom I
came; and I thought this to be a work that had no hurt in it: but
was rather worthy of commendation, than blame.</p>
<p><i>Wingate</i>.&nbsp; Whereat he told me, that if they would
not be so bound, my mittimus must be made, and I sent to the
jail, there to lie to the quarter sessions.</p>
<p>Now while my mittimus was making, the justice was withdrawn;
and in comes an old enemy to the truth, Dr Lindale, who, when he
was come in, fell to taunting at me with many reviling terms.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; To whom I answered, that I did not come
thither to talk with him, but with the justice.&nbsp; Whereat he
supposed that I had nothing to say for myself, and triumphed as
if he had got the victory; charging and condemning me for
meddling with that for which I could show no warrant; and asked
me, if I had taken the oaths? and if I had not, it was pity but
that I should be sent to prison, etc.</p>
<p>I told him, that if I was minded, I could answer to any sober
question that he should put to me.&nbsp; He then urged me again,
how I could prove it lawful for me to preach, with a great deal
of confidence of the victory.</p>
<p>But at last, because he should see that I could answer him if
I listed, I cited to him that verse in Peter, which saith,
<i>every man hath received the gift</i>, <i>even so let him
minister the same</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>
<p><i>Lind.</i>&nbsp; Aye, saith he, to whom is that spoken?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; To whom, said I, why to every man that hath
received a gift from God.&nbsp; Mark, saith the apostle, <i>As
every man that hath received a gift from God</i>, etc.; and
again, <i>You may all prophesy one by one</i>.&nbsp; Whereat the
man was a little stopt, and went a softlier pace: but not being
willing to lose the day, he began again, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lind.</i>&nbsp; Indeed, I do remember that I have read of
one Alexander a coppersmith, who did much oppose, and disturb the
apostles;&mdash;(aiming it is like at me, because I was a
tinker).</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; To which I answered, that I also had read of
very many priests and pharisees, that had their hands in the
blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><i>Lind.</i>&nbsp; Aye, saith he, and you are one of those
scribes and pharisees: for you, with a pretence, make long
prayers to devour widows&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I answered, that if he had got no more by
preaching and praying than I had done, he would not be so rich as
now he was.&nbsp; But that scripture coming into my mind,
<i>Answer not a fool according to his folly</i>, I was as sparing
of my speech as I could, without prejudice to truth.</p>
<p>Now by this time my mittimus was made, and I committed to the
constable, to be sent to the jail in Bedford, etc.</p>
<p>But as I was going, two of my brethren met with me by the way,
and desired the constable to stay, supposing that they should
prevail with the justice, through the favour of a pretended
friend, to let me go at liberty.&nbsp; So we did stay, while they
went to the justice; and after much discourse with him, it came
to this: that if I would come to him again, and say some certain
words to him, I should be released.&nbsp; Which when they told
me, I said if the words was such that might be said with a good
conscience, I should or else I should not.&nbsp; So through their
importunity went back again, but not believing that I should be
delivered: for I feared their spirit was too full of opposition
to the truth to let me go, unless I should, in something or
other, dishonour my God and wound my conscience.&nbsp; Wherefore,
as I went, I lifted up my heart to God, for light and strength to
be kept, that I might not do any thing that might either
dishonour Him, or wrong my own soul, or be a grief or
discouragement to any that was inclining after the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Well, when I came to the justice again, there was Mr
<i>Foster</i> of Bedford, who, coming out of another room, and
seeing me by the light of the candle (for it was dark night when
I went thither), he said unto me, Who is there? <i>John
Bunyan</i>? with such seeming affection, as if he would have
leaped on my neck and kissed <a name="citation191a"></a><a
href="#footnote191a" class="citation">[191a]</a> me, which made
me somewhat wonder, that such a man as he, with whom I had so
little acquaintance, and, besides, that had ever been a close
opposer of the ways of God, should carry himself so full of love
to me; but, afterwards, when I saw what he did, it caused me to
remember those sayings, <i>Their tongues are smoother than
oil</i>, <i>but their words are drawn swords</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; And
again, <i>Beware of men</i>, <i>etc.</i>&nbsp; When I <a
name="citation191b"></a><a href="#footnote191b"
class="citation">[191b]</a> had answered him, that blessed be
God, I was well; he said, What is the occasion of your being
here? or to that purpose.&nbsp; To whom I answered, that I was at
a meeting of people a little way off, intending to speak a word
of exhortation to them; the justice hearing thereof, said I, was
pleased to send his warrant to fetch me before him, etc.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; So (said he), I understand: but well, if
you will promise to call the people no more together, you shall
have your liberty to go home; for my brother is very loath to
send you to prison, if you will be but ruled.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Sir (said I), pray what do you mean by
calling the people together? my business is not anything among
them, when they are come together, but to exhort them to look
after the salvation of their souls, that they may be saved,
etc.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; Saith he, We must not enter into
explication, or dispute now; but if you will say you will call
the people no more together, you may have your liberty; if not,
you must be sent away to prison.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Sir, said I, I shall not force or compel any
man to hear me; but yet, if I come into any place where there is
a people met together, I should, according to the best of my
skill and wisdom, exhort and counsel them to seek out after the
Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of their souls.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said, That was none of my work; I must
follow my calling; and if I would but leave off preaching, and
follow my calling, I should have the justice&rsquo;s favour, and
be acquitted presently.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; To whom I said, that I could follow my
calling, and that too, namely, preaching the Word: and I did look
upon it as my duty to do them both, as I had an opportunity.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said, To have any such meetings was
against the law; and, therefore, he would have me leave off, and
say, I would call the people no more together.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; To whom I said, that I durst not make any
further promise; for my conscience would not suffer me to do
it.&nbsp; And again, I did look upon it as my duty to do as much
good as I could, not only in my trade, but also in communicating
to all people wheresoever I came the best knowledge I had in the
Word.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He told me that I was the nearest the
Papists of any, and that he would convince me of immediately.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I asked him, Wherein?</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said, In that we understood the
Scriptures literally.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that those that were to be
understood literally, we understood them so; but for those that
was to be understood otherwise, we endeavoured so to understand
them.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said, Which of the Scriptures do you
understand literally?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said this, <i>He that believes shall be
saved</i>.&nbsp; This was to be understood just as it is spoken;
that whosoever believeth in Christ shall, according to the plain
and simple words of the text, be saved.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said that I was ignorant, and did not
understand the Scriptures; for how, said he, can you understand
them when you know not the original Greek? etc.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; To whom I said, that if that was his
opinion, that none could understand the Scriptures but those that
had the original Greek, etc., then but a very few of the poorest
sort should be saved (this is harsh); yet the Scripture saith,
<i>That God hides these things from the wise and prudent</i>
(that is, from the learned of the world), <i>and reveals them to
babes and sucklings</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said there were none that heard me but a
company of foolish people.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that there was the wise as well
as the foolish that do hear me; and again, those that were most
commonly counted foolish by the world are the wisest before God;
also, that God had rejected the wise, and mighty, and noble, and
chosen the foolish, and the base.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He told me that I made people neglect their
calling; and that God had commanded people to work six days, and
serve Him on the seventh.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that it was the duty of people,
(both rich and poor), to look out for their souls on them days as
well as for their bodies; and that God would have His people
exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; He said again that there were none but a
company of poor, simple, ignorant people that come to hear
me.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that the foolish and the ignorant
had most need of teaching and information; and, therefore, it
would be profitable for me to go on in that work.</p>
<p><i>Fost.</i>&nbsp; Well, said he, to conclude, but will you
promise that you will not call the people together any more? and
then you may be released and go home.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that I durst say no more than I
had said; for I durst not leave off that work which God had
called me to.</p>
<p>So he withdrew from me, and then came several of the
justice&rsquo;s servants to me, and told me that I stood so much
upon a nicety.&nbsp; Their master, they said, was willing to let
me go; and if I would but say I would call the people no more
together, I might have my liberty, etc.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told them there were more ways than one in
which a man might be said to call the people together.&nbsp; As
for instance, if a man get upon the market-place, and there read
a book, or the like, though he do not say to the people, Sirs,
come hither and hear; yet if they come to him because he reads,
he, by his very reading, may be said to call them together;
because they would not have been there to hear if he had not been
there to read.&nbsp; And seeing this might be termed a calling
the people together; I durst not say, I would not call them
together; for then, by the same argument, my preaching might be
said to call them together.</p>
<p><i>Wing. and Fost.</i>&nbsp; Then came the justice and Mr
Foster to me again; (we had a little more discourse about
preaching, but because the method of it is out of my mind, I pass
it); and when they saw that I was at a point, and would not be
moved nor persuaded, Mr Foster, the man that did at first express
so much love to me, told the justice that then he must send me
away to prison.&nbsp; And that he would do well, also, if he
would present all those that were the cause of my coming among
them to meetings.&nbsp; Thus we parted.</p>
<p>And, verily, as I was going forth of the doors, I had much ado
to forbear saying to them that I carried the peace of God along
with me; but I held my peace, and, blessed be the Lord, went away
to prison, with God&rsquo;s comfort in my poor soul.</p>
<p>After I had lain in the jail five or six days, the brethren
sought means, again, to get me out by bondsmen; (for so ran my
mittimus, that I should lie there till I could find
sureties).&nbsp; They went to a justice at Elstow, one Mr
Crumpton, to desire him to take bond for my appearing at the
quarter sessions.&nbsp; At the first he told them he would; but
afterwards he made a demur at the business, and desired first to
see my mittimus, which ran to this purpose: That I went about to
several conventicles in the county, to the great disparagement of
the government of the church of England, etc.&nbsp; When he had
seen it, he said that there might be something more against me
than was expressed in my mittimus; and that he was but a young
man, therefore he durst not do it.&nbsp; This my jailor told me;
and, whereat I was not at all daunted but rather glad, and saw
evidently that the Lord had heard me; for before I went down to
the justice, I begged of God that if I might do more good by
being at liberty than in prison, that then I might be set at
liberty; but if not, His will be done; for I was not altogether
without hopes but that my imprisonment might be an awakening to
the saints in the country, therefore I could not tell well which
to choose; only I, in that manner, did commit the thing to
God.&nbsp; And verily, at my return, I did meet my God sweetly in
the prison again, comforting of me and satisfying of me that it
was His will and mind that I should be there.</p>
<p>When I came back again to prison, as I was musing at the
slender answer of the justice, this word dropt in upon my heart
with some life, <i>For He knew that for envy they had delivered
Him</i>.</p>
<p>Thus have I, in short, declared the manner and occasion of my
being in prison; where I lie waiting the good will of God, to do
with me as He pleaseth; knowing that not one hair of my head can
fall to the ground without the will of my Father, which is in
heaven.&nbsp; Let the rage and malice of men be never so great,
they can do no more, nor go any further, than God permits them;
but when they have done their worst, We know all things shall
work together for good to them that love God.</p>
<p>Farewell.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Here is the Sum of my Examination before Justice</i> <span
class="smcap">Keelin</span>, <i>Justice</i> <span
class="smcap">Chester</span>, <i>Justice</i> <span
class="smcap">Blundale</span>, <i>Justice</i> <span
class="smcap">Beecher</span>, <i>Justice</i> <span
class="smcap">Snagg</span>, <i>etc.</i></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> I had lain in prison above
seven weeks, the quarter-sessions were to be kept in Bedford, for
the county thereof, unto which I was to be brought; and when my
jailor had set me before those justices, there was a bill of
indictment preferred against me.&nbsp; The extent thereof was as
followeth: That John Bunyan, of the town of Bedford, labourer,
being a person of such and such conditions, he hath (since such a
time) devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to church
to hear Divine service, and is a common upholder of several
unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and
distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom, contrary to the
laws of our sovereign lord the King, etc.</p>
<p><i>The Clerk</i>.&nbsp; When this was read, the clerk of the
sessions said unto me, What say you to this?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, that as to the first part of it, I
was a common frequenter of the Church of God.&nbsp; And was also,
by grace, a member with the people, over whom Christ is the
Head.</p>
<p><i>Keelin</i>.&nbsp; But, saith Justice <i>Keelin</i> (who was
the judge in that court), do you come to church (you know what I
mean); to the parish church, to hear Divine service?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I answered, No, I did not.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He asked me, Why?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Because I did not find it commanded
in the Word of God.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said, We were commanded to pray.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, But not by the Common
Prayer-Book.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said, How then?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, With the Spirit.&nbsp; As the
apostle saith, <i>I will pray with the Spirit</i>, <i>and with
the understanding</i>.&nbsp; 1 Cor. xiv. 15.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said, We might pray with the Spirit, and
with the understanding, and with the Common Prayer-Book also.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, that the prayers in the Common
Prayer-Book were such as was made by other men, and not by the
motions of the Holy Ghost, within our hearts; and as I said, the
apostle saith, he will pray with the Spirit, and with the
understanding; not with the Spirit and the Common
Prayer-Book.</p>
<p><i>Another Justice</i>.&nbsp; What do you count prayer?&nbsp;
Do you think it is to say a few words over before or among a
people?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, No, not so; for men might have many
elegant, or excellent words, and yet not pray at all; but when a
man prayeth, he doth, through a sense of those things which he
wants (which sense is begotten by the Spirit), pour out his heart
before God through Christ; though his words be not so many and so
excellent as others are.</p>
<p><i>Justices</i>.&nbsp; They said, That was true.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, This might be done without the
Common Prayer-Book.</p>
<p><i>Another</i>.&nbsp; One of them said (I think it was Justice
<i>Blundale</i>, or Justice <i>Snagg</i>), How should we know
that you do not write out your prayers first, and then read them
afterwards to the people?&nbsp; This he spake in a laughing
way.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, it is not our use, to take a pen and
paper, and write a few words thereon, and then go and read it
over to a company of people.</p>
<p>But how should we know it, said he?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Sir, it is none of our custom, said I.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; But said Justice <i>Keelin</i>, It is
lawful to use the Common Prayer, and such like forms: for Christ
taught His disciples to pray, as John also taught his
disciples.&nbsp; And further, said he, Cannot one man teach
another to pray?&nbsp; Faith comes by hearing; and one man may
convince another of sin, and therefore prayers made by men, and
read over, are good to teach, and help men to pray.</p>
<p>While he was speaking these words, God brought that word into
my mind, in the eighth of the Romans, at the 26th verse.&nbsp; I
say, God brought it, for I thought not on it before: but as he
was speaking, it came so fresh into my mind, and was set so
evidently before me, as if the scripture had said, Take me, take
me; so when he had done speaking,</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Sir, the scripture saith, that <i>it
is the spirit that helpeth our infirmities</i>; for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us, with sighs and groanings which cannot be
uttered.&nbsp; Mark, said I, it doth not say the Common
Prayer-Book teacheth us how to pray, but the Spirit.&nbsp; And it
is <i>the Spirit that helpeth our infirmities</i>, saith the
apostle; he doth not say it is the Common Prayer-Book.</p>
<p>And as to the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, although it be an easy
thing to say, <i>Our Father</i>, etc., with the mouth; yet there
is very few that can, in the Spirit, say the two first words in
that prayer; that is, that can call God their Father, as knowing
what it is to be born again, and as having experience, that they
are begotten of the Spirit of God: which if they do not, all is
but babbling, etc.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; Justice <i>Keelin</i> said that that was a
truth.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; And I say further, as to your saying that
one man may convince another of sin, and that faith comes by
hearing, and that one man may tell another how he should pray,
etc., I say men may tell each other of their sins, but it is the
Spirit that must convince them.</p>
<p>And though it be said that <i>faith comes by hearing</i>: yet
it is the Spirit that worketh faith in the heart through hearing,
or else <i>they are not profited by hearing</i>.&nbsp; Heb. iv.
12.</p>
<p>And that though one man may tell another how he should pray:
yet, as I said before, he cannot pray, nor make his condition
known to God, except the Spirit help.&nbsp; It is not the Common
Prayer-Book that can do this.&nbsp; It is the <i>Spirit that
showeth us our sins</i>, and the <i>Spirit that showeth us a
Saviour</i>, Jn. xvi. 16, and the Spirit that stirreth up in our
hearts desires to come to God, for such things as we stand in
need of, Matt. xi. 27, even sighing out our souls unto Him for
them with <i>groans which cannot be uttered</i>.&nbsp; With other
words to the same purpose.&nbsp; At this they were set.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; But says Justice <i>Keelin</i>, What have
you against the Common Prayer-Book?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Sir, if you will hear me, I shall
lay down my reasons against it.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said I should have liberty; but first,
said he, let me give you one caution; take heed of speaking
irreverently of the Common Prayer-Book; for if you do so, you
will bring great damage upon yourself.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; So I proceeded, and said, My first reason
was, because it was not commanded in the Word of God, and
therefore I could not use it.</p>
<p><i>Another</i>.&nbsp; One of them said, Where do you find it
commanded in the Scripture, that you should go to <i>Elstow</i>,
or <i>Bedford</i>, and yet it is lawful to go to either of them,
is it not?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, To go to <i>Elstow</i>, or
<i>Bedford</i>, was a civil thing, and not material, though not
commanded, and yet God&rsquo;s Word allowed me to go about my
calling, and therefore if it lay there, then to go thither,
etc.&nbsp; But to pray, was a great part of the Divine worship of
God, and therefore it ought to be done according to the rule of
God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p><i>Another</i>.&nbsp; One of them said, He will do harm; let
him speak no further.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; Justice <i>Keelin</i> said, No, no, never
fear him, we are better established than so; he can do no harm;
we know the Common Prayer-Book hath been ever since the
apostles&rsquo; time, and it is lawful for it to be used in the
church.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Show me the place in the epistles,
where the Common Prayer-Book is written, or one text of
Scripture, that commands me to read it, and I will use it.&nbsp;
But yet, notwithstanding, said I, they that have a mind to use
it, they have their liberty; that is, I would not keep them from
it; but for our parts, we can pray to God without it.&nbsp;
Blessed be His name!</p>
<p>With that, one of them said, Who is your God?&nbsp;
Beelzebub?&nbsp; Moreover, they often said, that I was possessed
with the spirit of delusion, and of the devil.&nbsp; All which
sayings I passed over; the Lord forgive them!&nbsp; And further,
I said, Blessed be the Lord for it; we are encouraged to meet
together, and to pray, and exhort one another; for, we have had
the comfortable presence of God among us.&nbsp; For ever blessed
be His holy name!</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; Justice <i>Keelin</i> called this
pedler&rsquo;s French, saying, that I must leave off my
canting.&nbsp; The Lord open his eyes!</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said that we ought to exhort one another
daily, while it is called to-day, etc.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; Justice <i>Keelin</i> said that I ought not
to preach; and asked me where I had my authority? with other such
like words.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said that I would prove that it was lawful
for me, and such as I am, to preach the Word of God.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said unto me, By what Scripture?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, By that in the first epistle of
Peter, chap. iv. 10, 11, and Acts xviii., with other Scriptures,
which he would not suffer me to mention.&nbsp; But said, Hold;
not so many, which is the first?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said this: <i>As every man hath received
the gift</i>, <i>even so let him minister the same unto
another</i>, <i>as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God</i>.&nbsp; <i>If any man speak</i>, <i>let him speak as the
oracles of God</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said, Let me a little open that
Scripture to you: <i>As every man hath received the gift</i>;
that is, said he, as every one hath received a trade, so let him
follow it.&nbsp; If any man have received a gift of tinkering, as
thou hast done, let him follow his tinkering.&nbsp; And so other
men their trades.&nbsp; And the divine his calling, etc.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Nay, sir, said I, but it is most clear, that
the apostle speaks here of preaching the Word; if you do but
compare both the verses together, the next verse explains this
gift what it is, saying, <i>if any man speak</i>, <i>let him
speak as the oracles of God</i>.&nbsp; So that it is plain, that
the Holy Ghost doth not so much in this place exhort to civil
callings, as to the exercising of those gifts that we have
received from God.&nbsp; I would have gone on, but he would not
give me leave.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said, We might do it in our families,
but not otherways.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, If it was lawful to do good to some,
it was lawful to do good to more.&nbsp; If it was a good duty to
exhort our families, it was good to exhort others; but if they
held it a sin to meet together to seek the face of God, and
exhort one another to follow Christ, I should sin still; for so
we should do.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; He said he was not so well versed in
Scripture as to dispute, or words to that purpose.&nbsp; And
said, moreover, that they could not wait upon me any longer; but
said to me, Then you confess the indictment, do you not?&nbsp;
Now, and not till now, I saw I was indicted.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, This I confess, we have had many
meetings together, both to pray to God, and to exhort one
another, and that we had the sweet comforting presence of the
Lord among us for our encouragement; blessed be His name
therefore.&nbsp; I confessed myself guilty no otherwise.</p>
<p><i>Keel.</i>&nbsp; Then, said he, bear your judgment.&nbsp;
You must be had back again to prison, and there lie for three
months following; and at three months&rsquo; end, if you do not
submit to go to church to hear Divine service, and leave your
preaching, you must be banished the realm: and if, after such a
day as shall be appointed you to be gone, you shall be found in
this realm, etc., or be found to come over again without special
licence from the king, etc., you must stretch by the neck for it,
I tell you plainly: and so he bid my jailor have me away.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him, as to this matter, I was at a
point with him; for if I were out of prison to-day, I would
preach the Gospel again to-morrow, by the help of God.</p>
<p><i>Another</i>.&nbsp; To which one made me some answer: but my
jailor pulling me away to be gone, I could not tell what he
said.</p>
<p>Thus I departed from them; and I can truly say, I bless the
Lord <i>Jesus Christ</i> for it, that my heart was sweetly
refreshed in the time of my examination, and also afterwards, at
my returning to the prison.&nbsp; So that I found Christ&rsquo;s
words more than bare trifles, where He saith, <i>I will give you
a mouth and wisdom</i>, <i>which all your adversaries shall not
be able to gainsay</i>, <i>nor resist</i>.&nbsp; Luke xxi.
15.&nbsp; And that His peace no man can take from us.</p>
<p>Thus have I given you the substance of my examination.&nbsp;
The Lord make this profitable to all that shall read or hear
it.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>The Substance of some Discourse had between the Clerk of
the Peace and myself</i>; <i>when he came to admonish me</i>,
<i>according to the tenor of that Law</i>, <i>by which I was in
prison</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had lain in prison other
twelve weeks, and now not knowing what they intended to do with
me, upon the third of April 1661, comes Mr Cobb unto me (as he
told me), being sent by the justices to admonish me; and demand
of me submittance to the church of England, etc.&nbsp; The extent
of our discourse was as followeth.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; When he was come into the house he sent for
me out of my chamber; who, when I was come unto him, he said,
Neighbour <i>Bunyan</i>, how do you do?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I thank you, Sir, said I, very well, blessed
be the Lord.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Saith he, I come to tell you, that it is
desired you would submit yourself to the laws of the land, or
else at the next sessions it will go worse with you, even to be
sent away out of the nation, or else worse than that.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said that I did desire to demean myself in
the world, both as becometh a man and a Christian.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But, saith he, you must submit to the laws
of the land, and leave off those meetings which you was wont to
have; for the statute-law is directly against it; and I am sent
to you by the justices to tell you that they do intend to
prosecute the law against you if you submit not.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Sir, I conceive that that law by
which I am in prison at this time, doth not reach or condemn
either me, or the meetings which I do frequent; that law was made
against those, that being designed to do evil in their meetings,
making the exercise of religion their pretence, to cover their
wickedness.&nbsp; It doth not forbid the private meetings of
those that plainly and simply make it their only end to worship
the Lord, and to exhort one another to edification.&nbsp; My end
in meeting with others is simply to do as much good as I can, by
exhortation and counsel, according to that small measure of light
which God hath given me, and not to disturb the peace of the
nation.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Every one will say the same, said he; you
see the late insurrection <a name="citation210"></a><a
href="#footnote210" class="citation">[210]</a> at <i>London</i>,
under what glorious pretences they went; and yet, indeed, they
intended no less than the ruin of the kingdom and
commonwealth.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; That practice of theirs, I abhor, said I;
yet it doth not follow that, because they did so, therefore all
others will do so.&nbsp; I look upon it as my duty to behave
myself under the King&rsquo;s government, both as becomes a man
and a Christian, and if an occasion were offered me, I should
willingly manifest my loyalty to my Prince, both by word and
deed.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Well, said he, I do not profess myself to
be a man that can dispute; but this I say, truly, neighbour
<i>Bunyan</i>, I would have you consider this matter seriously,
and submit yourself; you may have your liberty to exhort your
neighbour in private discourse, so be you do not call together an
assembly of people; and, truly, you may do much good to the
church of Christ, if you would go this way; and this you may do,
and the law not abridge you of it.&nbsp; It is your private
meetings that the law is against.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Sir, said I, if I may do good to one by my
discourse? why may I not do good to two?&nbsp; And if to two, why
not to four, and so to eight? etc.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Ay, saith he, and to a hundred, I warrant
you.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Yes, Sir, said I, I think I should not be
forbid to do as much good as I can.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But, saith he, you may but pretend to do
good, and instead, notwithstanding, do harm, by seducing the
people; you are, therefore, denied your meeting so many together,
lest you should do harm.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; And yet, said I, you say the law tolerates
me to discourse with my neighbour; surely there is no law
tolerates me seduce any one; therefore if I may by the law
discourse with one, surely it is to do him good; and if I by
discoursing may do good to one, surely, by the same law, I may do
good to many.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; The law, saith he, doth expressly forbid
your private meetings; therefore they are not to be
tolerated.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that I would not entertain so
much uncharitableness of that Parliament in the 35th of
<i>Elizabeth</i>, or of the Queen herself, as to think they did,
by that law, intend the oppressing of any of God&rsquo;s
ordinances, or the interrupting any in way of God; but men may,
in the wresting of it, turn it against the way of God; but take
the law in itself, and it only fighteth against those that drive
at mischief in their hearts and meeting, making religion only
their cloak, colour, or pretence; for so are the words of the
statute: <i>If any meetings</i>, <i>under colour or pretence of
religion</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Very good; therefore the king, seeing that
pretences are usually in and among people, so as to make religion
their pretence only; therefore he, and the law before him, doth
forbid such private meetings, and tolerates only public; you may
meet in public.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Sir, said I, let me answer you in a
similitude: Set the case that, at such a wood corner, there did
usually come forth thieves, to do mischief; must there therefore
a law be made, that every one that cometh out there shall be
killed?&nbsp; May not there come out true men as well as thieves
out from thence?&nbsp; Just thus is it in this case; I do think
there may be many that may design the destruction of the
commonwealth; but it doth not follow therefore that all private
meetings are unlawful; those that transgress, let them be
punished.&nbsp; And if at any time I myself should do any act in
my conversation as doth not become a man and Christian, let me
bear the punishment.&nbsp; And as for your saying I may meet in
public, if I may be suffered, I would gladly do it.&nbsp; Let me
have but meeting enough in public, and I shall care the less to
have them in private.&nbsp; I do not meet in private because I am
afraid to have meetings in public.&nbsp; I bless the Lord that my
heart is at that point, that if any man can lay any thing to my
charge, either in doctrine or in practice, in this particular,
that can be proved error or heresy, I am willing to disown it,
even in the very market-place; but if it be truth, then to stand
to it to the last drop of my blood.&nbsp; And, Sir, said I, you
ought to commend me for so doing.&nbsp; To err and to be a
heretic are two things; I am no heretic, because I will not stand
refractorily to defend any one thing that is contrary to the
Word.&nbsp; Prove any thing which I hold to be an error, and I
will recant it.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But, goodman <i>Bunyan</i>, said he,
methinks you need not stand so strictly upon this one thing, as
to have meetings of such public assemblies.&nbsp; Cannot you
submit, and, notwithstanding, do as much good as you can, in a
neighbourly way, without having such meetings?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Truly, Sir, said I, I do not desire to
commend myself, but to think meanly of myself; yet when I do most
despise myself, taking notice of that small measure of light
which God hath given me, also that the people of the Lord (by
their own saying), are edified thereby.&nbsp; Besides, when I see
that the Lord, through grace, hath in some measure blessed my
labour, I dare not but exercise that gift which God hath given me
for the good of the people.&nbsp; And I said further, that I
would willingly speak in public if I might.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; He said, that I might come to the public
assemblies and hear.&nbsp; What though you do not preach? you may
hear.&nbsp; Do not think yourself so well enlightened, and that
you have received a gift so far above others, but that you may
hear other men preach.&nbsp; Or to that purpose.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him, I was as willing to be taught as
to give instruction, and I looked upon it as my duty to do both;
for, said I, a man that is a teacher, he himself may learn also
from another that teacheth, as the apostle saith, <i>We may all
prophesy one by one</i>, <i>that all may learn</i>.&nbsp; 1 Cor.
xiv. 31.&nbsp; That is, every man that hath received a gift from
God, he may dispense it, that others may be comforted; and when
he hath done, he may hear and learn, and be comforted himself of
others.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But, said he, what if you should forbear
awhile, and sit still, till you see further how things will
go?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Sir, said I, <i>Wickliffe</i> saith, that he
which leaveth off preaching and hearing of the Word of God for
fear of excommunication of men, he is already excommunicated of
God, and shall in the day of judgment be counted a traitor to
Christ. <a name="citation214"></a><a href="#footnote214"
class="citation">[214]</a></p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Ay, saith he, they that do not hear shall
be so counted indeed; do you, therefore, hear?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; But, Sir, said I, he saith, he that shall
leave off either preaching or hearing, etc.&nbsp; That is, if he
hath received a gift for edification, it is his sin, if he doth
not lay it out in a way of exhortation and counsel, according to
the proportion of his gift; as well as to spend his time
altogether in hearing others preach.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But, said he, how shall we know that you
have received a gift?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Said I, Let any man hear and search, and
prove the doctrine by the Bible.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But will you be willing, said he, that two
indifferent persons shall determine the case; and will you stand
by their judgment?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Are they infallible?</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; He said, No.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Then, said I, it is possible my judgment may
be as good as theirs.&nbsp; But yet I will pass by either, and in
this matter be judged by the Scriptures; I am sure that is
infallible, and cannot err.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But, said he, who shall be judge between
you, for you take the Scriptures one way, and they another?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said the Scripture should: and that by
comparing one Scripture with another; for that will open itself,
if it be rightly compared.&nbsp; As for instance, if under the
different apprehensions of the word <i>Mediator</i>, you would
know the truth of it, the Scriptures open it, and tell us that he
that is a mediator must take up the business between two, and a
mediator is not a mediator of one,&mdash;<i>but God is one</i>,
<i>and there is one Mediator between God and men</i>, <i>even the
man Christ Jesus</i>.&nbsp; Gal. iii. 20; 1 Tim. ii. 5.&nbsp; So
likewise the Scripture calleth Christ a <i>complete</i>, or
perfect, or able <i>high priest</i>.&nbsp; That is opened in that
He is called man, and also God.&nbsp; His blood also is
discovered to be effectually efficacious by the same
things.&nbsp; So the Scripture, as touching the matter of meeting
together, etc., doth likewise sufficiently open itself and
discover its meaning.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; But are you willing, said he, to stand to
the judgment of the church?</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; Yes, Sir, said I, to the approbation of the
church of God; (the church&rsquo;s judgment is best expressed in
Scripture).&nbsp; We had much other discourse which I cannot well
remember, about the laws of the nation, and submission to
governments; to which I did tell him, that I did look upon myself
as bound in conscience to walk according to all righteous laws,
and that, whether there was a king or no; and if I did any thing
that was contrary, I did hold it my duty to bear patiently the
penalty of the law, that was provided against such offenders;
with many more words to the like effect.&nbsp; And said,
moreover, that to cut off all occasions of suspicion from any, as
touching the harmlessness of my doctrine in private, I would
willingly take the pains to give any one the notes of all my
sermons; for I do sincerely desire to live quietly in my country,
and to submit to the present authority.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Well, neighbour <i>Bunyan</i>, said he, but
indeed I would wish you seriously to consider of these things,
between this and the quarter-sessions, and to submit
yourself.&nbsp; You may do much good if you continue still in the
land; but alas, what benefit will it be to your friends, or what
good can you do to them, if you should be sent away beyond the
seas into <i>Spain</i>, or <i>Constantinople</i>, or some other
remote part of the world?&nbsp; Pray be ruled.</p>
<p><i>Jailor</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, Sir, I hope he will be ruled.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I shall desire, said I, in all honesty to
behave myself in the nation, whilst I am in it.&nbsp; And if I
must be so dealt withal, as you say, I hope God will help me to
bear what they shall lay upon me.&nbsp; I know no evil that I
have done in this matter, to be so used.&nbsp; I speak as in the
presence of God.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; You know, saith he, that the Scripture
saith, <i>the powers that be</i>, <i>are ordained of God</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I said, Yes, and that I was to submit to the
King as supreme, and also to the governors, as to them who are
sent by Him.</p>
<p><i>Cobb</i>.&nbsp; Well then, said he, the King then commands
you, that you should not have any private meetings; because it is
against his law, and he is ordained of God, therefore you should
not have any.</p>
<p><i>Bun.</i>&nbsp; I told him that <i>Paul</i> did own the
powers that were in his day, to be of God; and yet he was often
in prison under them for all that.&nbsp; And also, though
<i>Jesus Christ</i> told <i>Pilate</i>, that He had no power
against him, but of God, yet He died under the same
<i>Pilate</i>; and yet, said I, I hope you will not say that
either <i>Paul</i>, or Christ, were such as did deny magistracy,
and so sinned against God in slighting the ordinance.&nbsp; Sir,
said I, the law hath provided two ways of obeying: the one to do
that which I, in my conscience, do believe that I am bound to do,
actively; and where I cannot obey actively, there I am willing to
lie down, and to suffer what they shall do unto me.&nbsp; At this
he sat still, and said no more; which when he had done, I did
thank him for his civil and meek discoursing with me; and so we
parted.</p>
<p>O! that we might meet in heaven!</p>

<p><i>Here followeth a discourse between my Wife and the
Judges</i>, <i>with others</i>, <i>touching my Deliverance at the
Assizes following</i>; <i>the which I took from her own
Mouth</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> that I had received this
sentence of banishing, or hanging, from them, and after the
former admonition, touching the determination of the justices if
I did not recant; just when the time drew nigh, in which I should
have abjured, or have done worse (as Mr Cobb told me), came the
time in which the King was to be crowned. <a
name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a>&nbsp; Now, at the coronation of kings,
there is usually a releasement of divers prisoners, by virtue of
his coronation; in which privilege also I should have had my
share; but that they took me for a convicted person, and
therefore, unless I sued out a pardon (as they called it), I
could have no benefit thereby, notwithstanding, yet, forasmuch as
the coronation proclamation did give liberty, from the day the
King was crowned, to that day twelvemonth, to sue them out;
therefore, though they would not let me out of prison, as they
let out thousands, yet they could not meddle with me, as touching
the execution of their sentence; because of the liberty offered
for the suing out of pardons.&nbsp; Whereupon I continued in
prison till the next assizes, which are called <i>Midsummer
assizes</i>, being then kept in <i>August</i>, 1661.</p>
<p>Now, at that assizes, because I would not leave any possible
means unattempted that might be lawful, I did, by my wife,
present a petition to the judges three times, that I might be
heard, and that they would impartially take my case into
consideration.</p>
<p>The first time my wife went, she presented it to Judge
<i>Hale</i>, who very mildly received it at her hand, telling her
that he would do her and me the best good he could; but he
feared, he said, he could do none.&nbsp; The next day, again,
lest they should, through the multitude of business, forget me,
we did throw another petition into the coach to Judge
<i>Twisdon</i>; who, when he had seen it, snapt her up, and
angrily told her that I was a convicted person, and could not be
released, unless I would promise to preach no more, etc.</p>
<p>Well, after this, she yet again presented another to judge
Hale, as he sat on the bench, who, as it seemed, was willing to
give her audience.&nbsp; Only Justice <i>Chester</i> being
present, stept up and said, that I was convicted in the court,
and that I was a hot-spirited fellow (or words to that purpose),
whereat he waived it, and did not meddle therewith.&nbsp; But
yet, my wife being encouraged by the high-sheriff, did venture
once more into their presence (as the poor widow did before the
unjust judge) to try what she could do with them for my liberty,
before they went forth of the town.&nbsp; The place where she
went to them, was to the <i>Swan-chamber</i>, where the two
judges, and many justices and gentry of the country, was in
company together.&nbsp; She then coming into the chamber with a
bashed face, and a trembling heart, began her errand to them in
this manner:&mdash;</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; My lord (directing herself to judge Hale),
I make bold to come once again to your Lordship, to know what may
be done with my husband.</p>
<p><i>Judge Hale</i>.&nbsp; To whom he said, Woman, I told thee
before I could do thee no good; because they have taken that for
a conviction which thy husband spoke at the sessions: and unless
there be something done to undo that, I can do thee no good.</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; My lord, said she, he is kept unlawfully
in prison; they clapped him up before there was any proclamation
against the meetings; the indictment also is false.&nbsp;
Besides, they never asked him whether he was guilty or no;
neither did he confess the indictment.</p>
<p><i>One of the Justices</i>.&nbsp; Then one of the justices
that stood by, whom she knew not, said, My Lord, he was lawfully
convicted.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; It is false, said she; for when they said to
him, Do you confess the indictment? he said only this, that he
had been at several meetings, both where there were preaching the
Word, and prayer, and that they had God&rsquo;s presence among
them.</p>
<p><i>Judge Twisdon</i>.&nbsp; Whereat Judge <i>Twisdon</i>
answered very angrily, saying, What, you think we can do what we
list; your husband is a breaker of the peace, and is convicted by
the law, etc.&nbsp; Whereupon Judge <i>Hale</i> called for the
Statute Book.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; But, said she, my lord, he was not lawfully
convicted.</p>
<p><i>Chester</i>.&nbsp; Then Justice <i>Chester</i> said, My
lord, he was lawfully convicted.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; It is false, said she; it was but a word of
discourse that they took for a conviction (as you heard
before).</p>
<p><i>Chest.</i>&nbsp; But it is recorded, woman; it is recorded,
said Justice <i>Chester</i>; as if it must be of necessity true,
because it was recorded.&nbsp; With which words he often
endeavoured to stop her mouth, having no other argument to
convince her, but it is recorded, it is recorded.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; My Lord, said she, I was a while since at
<i>London</i>, to see if I could get my husband&rsquo;s liberty;
and there I spoke with my lord <i>Barkwood</i>, one of the House
of Lords, to whom I delivered a petition, who took it of me and
presented it to some of the rest of the House of Lords, for my
husband&rsquo;s releasement; who, when they had seen it, they
said, that they could not release him, but had committed his
releasement to the judges, at the next assizes.&nbsp; This he
told me; and now I am come to you to see if any thing may be done
in this business, and you give neither releasement nor
relief.&nbsp; To which they gave her no answer, but made as if
they heard her not.</p>
<p><i>Chest.</i>&nbsp; Only Justice <i>Chester</i> was often up
with this,&mdash;He is convicted, and it is recorded.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; If it be, it is false, said she.</p>
<p><i>Chest.</i>&nbsp; My lord, said Justice <i>Chester</i>, he
is a pestilent fellow, there is not such a fellow in the country
again.</p>
<p><i>Twis.</i>&nbsp; What, will your husband leave
preaching?&nbsp; If he will do so, then send for him.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; My lord, said she, he dares not leave
preaching as long as he can speak.</p>
<p><i>Twis.</i>&nbsp; See here, what should we talk any more
about such a fellow?&nbsp; Must he do what he lists?&nbsp; He is
a breaker of the peace.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; She told him again, that he desired to live
peaceably, and to follow his calling, that his family might be
maintained; and moreover, said, My Lord, I have four small
children, that cannot help themselves, one of which is blind, and
have nothing to live upon, but the charity of good people.</p>
<p><i>Hale</i>.&nbsp; Hast thou four children? said Judge Hale;
thou art but a young woman to have four children.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; My lord, said she, I am but mother-in-law to
them, having not been married to him yet full two years.&nbsp;
Indeed, I was with child when my husband was first apprehended;
but being young, and unaccustomed to such things, said she, I
being smayed <a name="citation224"></a><a href="#footnote224"
class="citation">[224]</a> at the news, fell into labour, and so
continued for eight days, and then was delivered, but my child
died.</p>
<p><i>Hale</i>.&nbsp; Whereat, he looking very soberly on the
matter, said, Alas, poor woman!</p>
<p><i>Twis.</i>&nbsp; But Judge <i>Twisdon</i> told her, that she
made poverty her cloak; and said, moreover, that he understood I
was maintained better by running up and down a preaching, than by
following my calling.</p>
<p><i>Hale</i>.&nbsp; What is his calling? said Judge Hale.</p>
<p><i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; Then some of the company that stood by,
said, A tinker, my lord.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; Yes, said she; and because he is a tinker,
and a poor man, therefore he is despised, and cannot have
justice.</p>
<p><i>Hale</i>.&nbsp; Then Judge <i>Hale</i> answered very
mildly, saying, I tell thee, woman, seeing it is so, that they
have taken what thy husband spake for a conviction; thou must
either apply thyself to the King, or sue out his pardon, or get a
writ of error.</p>
<p><i>Chest.</i>&nbsp; But when Justice <i>Chester</i> heard him
give her this counsel; and especially (as she supposed) because
he spoke of a writ of error, he chafed, and seemed to be very
much offended; saying, My lord, he will preach and do what he
lists.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; He preacheth nothing but the Word of God,
said she.</p>
<p><i>Twis.</i>&nbsp; He preach the Word of God! said Twisdon;
and withal, she thought he would have struck her; he runneth up
and down, and doth harm.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; No, my lord, said she, it is not so; God
hath owned him, and done much good by him.</p>
<p><i>Twis.</i>&nbsp; God! said he, his doctrine is the doctrine
of the devil.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; My lord, said she, when the righteous Judge
shall appear, it will be known that his doctrine is not the
doctrine of the devil.</p>
<p><i>Twis.</i>&nbsp; My lord, said he, to Judge Hale, do not
mind her, but send her away.</p>
<p><i>Hale</i>.&nbsp; Then said Judge Hale, I am sorry, woman,
that I can do thee no good; thou must do one of those three
things aforesaid, namely, either to apply thyself to the King, or
sue out his pardon, or get a writ of error; but a writ of error
will be cheapest.</p>
<p><i>Wom.</i>&nbsp; At which Chester again seemed to be in a
chafe, and put off his hat, and as she thought, scratched his
head for anger: but when I saw, said she, that there was no
prevailing to have my husband sent for, though I often desired
them that they would send for him, that he might speak for
himself; telling them, that he could give them better
satisfaction than I could, in what they demanded of him, with
several other things, which now I forget; only this I remember,
that though I was somewhat timorous at my first entrance into the
chamber, yet before I went out, I could not but break forth into
tears, not so much because they were so hard-hearted against me,
and my husband, but to think what a sad account such poor
creatures will have to give at the coming of the Lord, when they
shall there answer for all things whatsoever they have done in
the body, whether it be good, or whether it be bad.</p>
<p>So, when I departed from them, the book of statutes was
brought, but what they said of it I know nothing at all, neither
did I hear any more from them.</p>

<p><i>Some Carriages of the Adversaries of God&rsquo;s Truth with
me at the next Assizes</i>, <i>which was on the</i> 19<i>th</i>
<i>of the first month</i>, 1662.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I <span class="smcap">shall</span> pass by what befell between
these two assizes, how I had, by my jailor, some liberty granted
me, more than at the first, and how I followed my wonted course
of preaching, taking all occasions that were put into my hand to
visit the people of God; exhorting them to be steadfast in the
faith of Jesus Christ, and to take heed that they touched not the
Common Prayer, etc., but to mind the Word of God, which giveth
direction to Christians in every point, being able to make the
man of God perfect in all things through faith in Jesus Christ,
and thoroughly to furnish him unto all good works.&nbsp; 2 Tim.
iii. 17.&nbsp; Also how I having, I say, somewhat more liberty,
did go to see the Christians at <i>London</i>; which my enemies
hearing of, were so angry, that they had almost cast my jailor
out of his place, threatening to indict him, and to do what they
could against him.&nbsp; They charged me also, that I went
thither to plot and raise division, and make insurrection, which,
God knows, was a slander; whereupon my liberty was more
straitened than it was before; so that I must not now look out of
the door.&nbsp; Well, when the next sessions came, which was
about the 10th of the 11th month (1661), I did expect to have
been very roundly dealt withal; but they passed me by, and would
not call me, so that I rested till the assizes, which was held
the 19th of the first month (1662) following; and when they came,
because I had a desire to come before the judge, I desired my
jailor to put my name into the calendar among the felons, and
made friends of the judge and high-sheriff, who promised that I
should be called: so that I thought what I had done might have
been effectual for the obtaining of my desire: but all was in
vain; for when the assizes came, though my name was in the
calendar, and also though both the judge and sheriff had promised
that I should appear before them, yet the justices and the clerk
of the peace, did so work it about, that I, notwithstanding, was
deferred, and was not suffered to appear: and although I say, I
do not know of all their carriages towards me, yet this I know,
that the clerk of the peace (Mr Cobb) did discover himself to be
one of my greatest opposers: for, first he came to my jailor and
told him that I must not go down before the judge, and therefore
must not be put into the calendar; to whom my jailor said, that
my name was in already.&nbsp; He bid him put it out again; my
jailor told him that he could not: for he had given the judge a
calendar with my name in it, and also the sheriff another.&nbsp;
At which he was very much displeased, and desired to see that
calendar that was yet in my jailor&rsquo;s hand, who, when he had
given it him, he looked on it, and said it was a false calendar;
he also took the calendar and blotted out my accusation, as my
jailor had written it (which accusation I cannot tell what it
was, because it was so blotted out), and he himself put in words
to this purpose: That John Bunyan was committed to prison; being
lawfully convicted for upholding of unlawful meetings and
conventicles, etc.&nbsp; But yet <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>for all this, fearing that what he
had done, unless he added thereto, it would not do, he first ran
to the clerk of the assizes; then to the justices, and
afterwards, because he would not leave any means unattempted to
hinder me, he came again to my jailor, and told him, that if I
did go down before the judge, and was released, he would make him
pay my fees, which he said was due to him; and further, told him,
that he would complain of him at the next quarter sessions for
making of false calendars, though my jailor himself, as I
afterwards learned, had put in my accusation worse than in itself
it was by far.&nbsp; And thus was I hindered and prevented at
that time also from appearing before the judge: and left in
prison.</p>

<h2><i>A Continuation of</i> Mr <span
class="smcap">Bunyan&rsquo;s Life</span>; <i>beginning where he
left off</i>, <i>and concluding with the Time and Manner of his
Death and Burial</i>: <i>together with his true Character</i>,
<i>etc.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Reader</span>, the painful and industrious
author of this book, has already given you a faithful and very
moving relation of the beginning and middle of the days of his
pilgrimage on earth; and since there yet remains somewhat worthy
of notice and regard, which occurred in the last scene of his
life, the which, for want of time, or fear, some over-censorious
people should impute it to him as an earnest coveting of praise
from men, he has not left behind him in writing.&nbsp; Wherefore,
as a true friend, and long acquaintance of Mr
<i>Bunyan&rsquo;s</i> that his good end may be known, as well as
his evil beginning, I have taken upon me, from my knowledge, and
the best account given by other of his friends, to piece this to
the thread too soon broke off, and so lengthen it out to his
entering upon eternity.</p>
<p>He has told you at large, of his birth and education; the evil
habits and corruptions of his youth; the temptations he struggled
and conflicted so frequently with, the mercies, comforts, and
deliverances he found, how he came to take upon him the preaching
of the Gospel; the slanders, reproaches and imprisonments that
attended him, and the progress he notwithstanding made (by the
assistance of God&rsquo;s grace) no doubt to the saving of many
souls: therefore take these things, as he himself hath
methodically laid them down in the words of verity; and so I pass
on to what remains.</p>
<p>After his being freed from his twelve years&rsquo;
imprisonment and upwards, for nonconformity, wherein he had time
to furnish the world with sundry good books, etc., and by his
patience, to move <i>Dr Barlow</i>, the then Bishop of
<i>Lincoln</i>, and other church-men, to pity his hard and
unreasonable sufferings, so far as to stand very much his
friends, in procuring his enlargement, or there perhaps he had
died, by the noisomeness and ill usage of the place.&nbsp; Being
now, I say, again at liberty, and having through mercy shaken off
his bodily fetters,&mdash;for those upon his soul were broken
before by the abounding grace that filled his heart,&mdash;he
went to visit those that had been a comfort to him in his
tribulation, with a Christian-like acknowledgment of their
kindness and enlargement of charity; giving encouragement by his
example, if it happened to be their hard haps to fall into
affliction or trouble, then to suffer patiently for the sake of a
good conscience, and for the love of God in Jesus Christ towards
their souls, and by many cordial persuasions, supported some
whose spirits began to sink low, through the fear of danger that
threatened their worldly concernment, so that the people found a
wonderful consolation in his discourse and admonitions.</p>
<p>As often as opportunity would admit, he gathered them together
(though the law was then in force against meetings) in convenient
places, and fed them with the sincere milk of the Word, that they
might grow up in grace thereby.&nbsp; To such as were anywhere
taken and imprisoned upon these accounts, he made it another part
of his business to extend his charity, and gather relief for such
of them as wanted.</p>
<p>He took great care to visit the sick, and strengthen them
against the suggestions of the tempter, which at such times are
very prevalent; so that they had cause for ever to bless God, Who
had put it into his heart, at such a time, to rescue them from
the power of the roaring lion, who sought to devour them; nor did
he spare any pains or labour in travel, though to remote
counties, where he knew or imagined any people might stand in
need of his assistance; insomuch that some, by these visitations
that he made, which was two or three every year (some, though in
a jeering manner no doubt, gave him the epithet of Bishop
<i>Bunyan</i>) whilst others envied him for his so earnestly
labouring in Christ&rsquo;s vineyard; yet the seed of the Word he
(all this while) sowed in the hearts of his congregation, watered
with the grace of God, brought forth in abundance, in bringing in
disciples to the church of Christ.</p>
<p>Another part of his time is spent in reconciling differences,
by which he hindered many mischiefs, and saved some families from
ruin, and in such fallings-out he was uneasy, till he found a
means to labour a reconciliation, and become a peace-maker, on
whom a blessing is promised in holy writ; and indeed in doing
this good office, he may be said to sum up his days, it being the
last undertaking of his life, as will appear in the close of this
paper.</p>
<p>When in the late reign, liberty of conscience was unexpectedly
given and indulged to dissenters of all persuasions, his piercing
wit penetrated the veil, and found that it was not for the
dissenters&rsquo; sakes they were so suddenly freed from the hard
prosecutions that had long lain heavy upon them, and set in a
manner, on an equal foot with the Church of <i>England</i>, which
the papists were undermining, and about to subvert: he foresaw
all the advantages that could have redounded to the dissenters
would have been no more than what <i>Polyphemus</i>, the
monstrous giant of <i>Sicily</i>, would have allowed
<i>Ulysses</i>, <i>viz.</i>: That he would eat his men first, and
do him the favour of being eaten last: for although Mr
<i>Bunyan</i>, following the examples of others, did lay hold of
this liberty, as an acceptable thing in itself, knowing God is
the only Lord of conscience, and that it is good at all times to
do according to the dictates of a good conscience, and that the
preaching the glad tidings of the Gospel is beautiful in the
preacher; yet in all this he moved with caution and a holy fear,
earnestly praying for the averting impending judgments, which he
saw, like a black tempest, hanging over our heads for our sins,
and ready to break in upon us, and that the
<i>Ninevites&rsquo;</i> remedy was now highly necessary: hereupon
he gathered his congregation at <i>Bedford</i>, where he mostly
lived, and had lived and spent the greatest part of his life; and
there being no convenient place to be had for the entertainment
of so great a confluence of people as followed him upon the
account of his teaching, he consulted with them for the building
of a meeting-house, to which they made their voluntary
contributions with all cheerfulness and alacrity; and the first
time he appeared there to edify, the place was so thronged, that
many was constrained to stay without, though the house was very
spacious, every one striving to partake of his instructions, that
were of his persuasion, and show their good-will towards him, by
being present at the opening of the place; and here he lived in
much peace and quiet of mind, contenting himself with that little
God had bestowed upon him, and sequestering himself from all
secular employments, to follow that of his call to the ministry;
for as God said to <i>Moses</i>, He that made the lips and heart,
can give eloquence and wisdom, without extraordinary acquirements
in an university.</p>
<p>During these things, there were regulators sent into all
cities and towns corporate, to new model the government in the
magistracy, etc., by turning out some, and putting in others:
against this Mr <i>Bunyan</i> expressed his zeal with some
weariness, as foreseeing the bad consequence that would attend
it, and laboured with his congregation to prevent their being
imposed on in this kind; and when a great man in those days,
coming to <i>Bedford</i> upon some such errand, sent for him, as
&rsquo;tis supposed, to give him a place of public trust, he
would by no means come at him, but sent his excuse.</p>
<p>When he was at leisure from writing and teaching, he often
came up to <i>London</i>, and there went among the congregations
of the non-conformists, and used his talent to the great
good-liking of the hearers; and even some to whom he had been
mis-represented, upon the account of his education, were
convinced of his worth and knowledge in sacred things, as
perceiving him to be a man of round judgment, delivering himself
plainly and powerfully; insomuch that many, who came mere
spectators for novelty sake rather than to edify and be improved,
went away well satisfied with what they heard, and wondered, as
the Jews did at the Apostles, <i>viz.</i>: Whence this man should
have these things; perhaps not considering that God more
immediately assists those that make it their business
industriously and cheerfully to labour in His vineyard.</p>
<p>Thus he spent his latter years in imitation of his great Lord
and Master, the ever-blessed Jesus; he went about doing good, so
that the most prying critic, or even Malice herself, is defied to
find, even upon the narrowest search or observation, any sully or
stain upon his reputation, with which he may be justly charged;
and this we note, as a challenge to those that have the least
regard for him, or them of his persuasion, and have one way or
other appeared in the front of those that oppressed him; and for
the turning whose hearts, in obedience to the commission and
commandment given him of God, he frequently prayed, and sometimes
sought a blessing for them, even with tears, the effects of
which, they may, peradventure, though undeservedly, have found in
their persons, friends, relations, or estates; for God will hear
the prayer of the faithful, and answer them, even for them that
vex them, as it happened in the case of <i>Job&rsquo;s</i>
praying for the three persons that had been grievous in their
reproach against him, even in the day of his sorrow.</p>
<p>But yet let me come a little nearer to particulars and periods
of time, for the better refreshing the memories of those that
knew his labour and suffering, and for the satisfaction of all
that shall read this book.</p>
<p>After he was sensibly convicted of the wicked state of his
life, and converted, he was baptized into the congregation, and
admitted a member thereof, <i>viz.</i>, in the year 1655, and
became speedily a very zealous professor; but upon the return of
King <i>Charles</i> to the crown in 1660, he was the 12th of
<i>November</i> taken, as he was edifying some good people that
were got together to hear the word, and confined in
<i>Bedford</i> jail for the space of six years, till the act of
Indulgence to dissenters being allowed, he obtained his freedom,
by the intercession of some in trust and power, that took pity on
his sufferings; but within six years afterwards he was again
taken up, <i>viz.</i>, in the year 1666, and was then confined
for six years more, when even the jailor took such pity of his
rigorous sufferings, that he did as the Egyptian jailor did to
<i>Joseph</i>, put all the care and trust in his hand: When he
was taken this last time, he was preaching on these words, viz.:
<i>Dost thou believe the Son of God</i>?&nbsp; And this
imprisonment continued six years, and when this was over, another
short affliction, which was an imprisonment of half a year, fell
to his share.&nbsp; During these confinements he wrote the
following books, viz.: <i>Of Prayer by the Spirit</i>: <i>The
Holy City&rsquo;s Resurrection</i>: <i>Grace Abounding</i>:
<i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, the first part.</p>
<p>In the last year of his twelve years&rsquo; imprisonment, the
pastor of the congregation at <i>Bedford</i> died, and he was
chosen to that care of souls, on the 12th of <i>December</i>
1671.&nbsp; And in this his charge, he often had disputes with
scholars that came to oppose him, as supposing him an ignorant
person, and though he argued plainly, and by Scripture, without
phrases and logical expressions, yet he nonplussed one who came
to oppose him in his congregation, by demanding, Whether or no we
had the true copies of the original Scriptures; and another, when
he was preaching, accused him of uncharitableness, for saying,
<i>It was very hard for most to be saved</i>; saying, by that he
went about to exclude most of his congregation; but he confuted
him, and put him to silence with the parable of the stony ground,
and other texts out of the 13th chapter of <i>St Matthew</i>, in
our Saviour&rsquo;s sermon out of a ship; all his methods being
to keep close to the Scriptures, and what he found not warranted
there, himself would not warrant nor determine, unless in such
cases as were plain, wherein no doubts or scruples did arise.</p>
<p>But not to make any further mention of this kind, it is well
known that this person managed all his affairs with such
exactness, as if he had made it his study, above all other
things, not to give occasion of offence, but rather suffer many
inconveniences, to avoid being never heard to reproach or revile
any, what injury soever he received, but rather to rebuke those
that did; and as it was in his conversation, so it is manifested
in those books he has caused to be published to the world; where
like the archangel disputing with Satan about the body of
<i>Moses</i>, as we find it in the epistle of <i>St Jude</i>,
brings no railing accusation (but leaves the rebukers, those that
persecuted him) to the Lord.</p>
<p>In his family he kept up a very strict discipline in prayer
and exhortation; being in this like <i>Joshua</i>, as the good
man expresses it, viz., <i>Whatsoever others did</i>, <i>as for
me and my house</i>, <i>we will serve the Lord</i>: and indeed a
blessing waited on his labours and endeavours, so that his wife,
as the Psalmist says, <i>was like a pleasant vine upon the walls
of his house</i>, <i>and his children like olive branches round
his table</i>; <i>for so shall it be with the man that fears the
Lord</i>, and though by reason of the many losses he sustained by
imprisonment and spoil, of his chargeable sickness, etc., his
earthly treasure swelled not to excess; he always had sufficient
to live decently and creditably, and with that he had the
greatest of all treasures, which is content; for as the wise man
says, <i>That is a continual feast</i>.</p>
<p>But where content dwells, even a poor cottage is a kingly
palace, and this happiness he had all his life long; not so much
minding this world, as knowing he was here as a pilgrim and
stranger, and had no tarrying city, but looked for one made with
hands eternal in the highest heavens: but at length was worn out
with sufferings, age, and often teaching, the day of his
dissolution drew near, and death, that unlocks the prison of the
soul, to enlarge it for a more glorious mansion, put a stop to
his acting his part on the stage of mortality; heaven, like
earthly princes, when it threatens war, being always so kind as
to call home its ambassadors before it be denounced, and even the
last act or undertaking of his, was a labour of love and charity;
for it so falling out that a young gentleman, a neighbour of Mr
<i>Bunyan&rsquo;s</i>, happening into the displeasure of his
father, and being much troubled in mind upon that account, and
also for that he heard his father purposed to disinherit him, or
otherwise deprive him of what he had to leave; he pitched upon Mr
<i>Bunyan</i> as a fit man to make way for his submission, and
prepare his father&rsquo;s mind to receive him; and he, as
willing to do any good office, as it could be requested, as
readily undertook it; and so riding to <i>Reading</i> in
<i>Berkshire</i>, he then there used such pressing arguments and
reasons against anger and passion, as also for love and
reconciliation, that the father was mollified, and his bowels
yearned to his returning son.</p>
<p>But Mr <i>Bunyan</i>, after he had disposed all things to the
best for accommodation, returning to <i>London</i>, and being
overtaken with excessive rains, coming to his lodgings extremely
wet, fell sick of a violent fever, which he bore with much
constancy and patience, and expressed himself as if he desired
nothing more than to be dissolved, and be with Christ, in that
case esteeming death as gain, and life only a tedious delaying
felicity expected; and finding his vital strength decay, having
settled his mind and affairs, as well as the shortness of time,
and the violence of his disease would permit, with a constant and
christian patience, he resigned his soul into the hands of his
most merciful Redeemer, following his pilgrim from the City of
Destruction, to the New <i>Jerusalem</i>; his better part having
been all along <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>there, in holy contemplation, pantings and breathings
after the hidden manna and water of life, as by many holy and
humble consolations expressed in his letters to several persons
in prison, and out of prison, too many to be inserted at
present.&nbsp; He died at the house of one Mr <i>Struddock</i>, a
grocer, at the Star on <i>Snow Hill</i>, in the parish of <i>St
Sepulchre&rsquo;s</i>, <i>London</i>, on the 12th of
<i>August</i> 1688, and in the sixtieth year of his age, <a
name="citation241"></a><a href="#footnote241"
class="citation">[241]</a> after ten days&rsquo; sickness; and
was buried in the new burying place near the Artillery Ground;
where he sleeps to the morning of the resurrection, in hopes of a
glorious rising to an incorruptible immortality of joy and
happiness; where no more trouble and sorrow shall afflict him,
but all tears be wiped away; when the just shall be incorporated
as members of Christ their head, and reign with Him as kings and
priests for ever.</p>
<h2><i>A brief Character of Mr</i> <span class="smcap">John
Bunyan</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> appeared in countenance to be of
a stern and rough temper, but in his conversation mild and
affable; not given to loquacity or much discourse in company,
unless some urgent occasion required it; observing never to boast
of himself or his parts, but rather seem low in his own eyes, and
submit himself to the judgment of others, abhorring lying and
swearing, being just in all that lay in his power to his word,
not seeming to revenge injuries, loving to reconcile differences,
and make friendship with all; he had a sharp quick eye,
accompanied with an excellent discerning of persons, being of
good judgment and quick wit.&nbsp; As for his person, he was tall
of stature, strong boned, though not corpulent, somewhat of a
ruddy face, with sparkling eyes, wearing his hair on his upper
lip, after the old British fashion; his hair reddish, but in his
latter days, time had sprinkled it with grey; his nose well set,
but not declining or bending, and his mouth moderate large; his
forehead somewhat high, and his habit always plain and
modest.&nbsp; And thus have we impartially described the internal
and external parts of a person, whose death hath been much
regretted; a person who had tried the smiles and frowns of time;
not puffed up in prosperity, nor shaken in adversity; always
holding the golden mean.</p>
<blockquote><p>In him at once did three great worthies shine,<br
/>
Historian, poet, and a choice divine:<br />
Then let him rest in undisturbed dust,<br />
Until the resurrection of the just.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
