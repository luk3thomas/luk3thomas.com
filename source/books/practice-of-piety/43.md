supper? (Luke xxii. 19, 20.)

that all the merits thereof are thine.

Soul. Lord, wherefore wouldst thou go to such a place where Judas knew
to find thee? (John xviii. 2.)

Christ. That thou mightst know that I went as willingly to suffer for
thy sin, as ever thou wentest to any place to commit a sin.

Soul. Lord, wherefore wouldst thou begin thy passion in a garden? (John
xviii. 1.)

iii. 3.)

asleep, when thou didst begin to fall into thy agony? (Matt. xxvi. 40.)

hunter (Psalm 134:7Psal cxxiv. 7.)

Soul. Lord, why shouldst thou suffer Judas, betraying thee, to kiss
thee? (Matt. xxvi. 49.)

begin to expiate sin, where Satan first brought it into the world (Gen.
iii. 4, 5.)

fiercely kindled against thee.

secure in thy death, and find more comfort in thy crosses.

cup might pass from thee? (Matt. xxvi. 39, 42, 44.)

which being due to thy sins, I was then to drink and endure for thee
(Gal. iii. 13.)

Soul. Lord, wherefore didst thou, after thy wish, submit thy will to
the will of thy Father? (Luke xxii. 42.)

unstript of his linen, who came out of his bed, hearing the stir at thy
apprehension and leading to the high priest? (Mark xiv. 51, 52.)

preserving out of their outrageous hands, all my disciples, who
otherwise had been worse handled by them than was that young man.

Soul. Lord, wherefore wouldst thou be bound? (Matt. xxvii. 2.)

learn, that there is no trust in man, and that salvation proceeds of my
mere mercy.

Soul. Lord, wherefore wouldst thou bring Peter to repentance by the
crowing of a cock? (Matt. xxvi. 74, 75.)

Christ. That none should despise the means which God hath appointed for
their conversion, though they seem never so mean.

Soul. Lord, wherefore didst thou at the cock-crowing turn and look upon
Peter? (Luke xxii. 61.)

Christ. Because thou mightst know, that without the help of my grace,
no means can turn a sinner unto God, when he is once fallen from him.

and crown thee with the crown of life and glory (1 Pet. v. 4; Rev. ii.
10.)

judgment-seat.

tyrant, mightst be restored to God, whose own thou art by right.

Soul. Wherefore, O Christ, didst thou acknowledge that Pilate had power
over thee from above? (John xix. 11.)

exalt himself above all principalities and powers (Tit. iii. 1; Rom.
xiii. 1; 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14.)

Soul. Lord, why wouldst thou suffer thy passion under Pontius Pilate,
being a Roman president to Caesar of Rome? (Luke xxiii. 1, 2; John xix.
13, &c.)

should chiefly persecute my church, and crucify me in my members (note
well Rev. xi. 8, and Rev. xvii. 5, 6; John xix. 16.)

Soul. But why, Lord, wouldst thou be condemned? (Luke xxiii. 24; Rom.
viii. 3.)

condemned by it.

against thee? (Matt. xxvii. 24; John xix. 6.)

and thy redemption effected (Rom. x. 4; 2 Cor. iii. 13.)

Soul. Lord, why didst thou cry out upon the cross, "My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark xv. 34.)

Christ. Lest thou, being forsaken of God, shouldst have been driven to
cry in the pains of hell, wo and alas! for evermore.

Soul. Lord, wherefore was there such a general darkness when thou didst
suffer and cry out upon the cross? (Matt. xxvii. 45.)

Christ. That thou mightst see an image of those hellish pains which I
suffered to deliver thee from the endless pains of hell, and
everlasting chains of darkness (2 Pet. ii. 4; Jude v. 6.)

Soul. Lord, why wouldst thou have thy arms nailed abroad?

Christ. That I might embrace thee more lovingly in the everlasting arms
of mercy (Mark. x. 16; Col. ii. 14; Deut. xxxiii. 27.)

Soul. Lord, why did the thief, that never wrought good before, obtain
paradise upon so short repentance? (Luke xxiii. 43.)

Christ. That thou mayst see the power of my death to forgive them that
repent, that no sinner needs despair.

Soul. Lord, why did not the other thief which hanged as near thee
obtain the like mercy? (Luke xxiii. 39.)

(Rom. ix. 18.)

partition-wall between Jews and Gentiles, and that the way to heaven is
now open to all believers (Eph. ii. 14; Heb. x. 19, 20.)

Soul. Lord, wherefore did the earth quake and the stones cleave at thy
death? (Matt. xxvii. 51.)

Christ. For horror to bear her Lord dying, and to upbraid the cruel
hardness of sinners' hearts.

Soul. Lord, wherefore did not the soldiers break thy legs, as they did
those of the thieves who hanged at thy right and left hand? (Exod. xii.
46; John xix. 33.)

Christ. That thou mightst know that they had not power to do any more
unto me than the scripture had foretold that they should do, and I
should suffer to save thee.

Soul. Lord, wherefore was thy side opened with a spear?

Christ. That thou mightst have a way to come nearer my heart.

Soul. Lord, wherefore ran there out of thy precious side blood and
water?

Christ. To assure thee that I was slain indeed, seeing my heart-blood
gushed out, and the water which compassed ray heart flowed forth after
it, which once spilt, must needs die. [147]

Soul. Lord, wherefore ran the blood first by itself, and the water
afterwards by itself, out of thy blessed wound? (1 John v. 6.)

Christ. To assure thee of two things:--First, That by my blood-shedding
justification and sanctification were effected to save thee. Secondly,
That my Spirit, by the conscionable use of the water in baptism, and
blood in the eucharist, will effect in thee righteousness and holiness,
by which thou shalt glorify me.

death's wound, and was overcome.

Soul. Lord, wherefore wouldst thou be buried by two such honourable
senators as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea? (Matt. xxvii. 57; John
xix. 39, 40.)

Christ. That the truth of my death, the cause of thy life, might more
evidently appear unto all.

Soul. Lord, wherefore wast thou buried in a new sepulchre, wherein was
never man laid? (John xix. 41; Matt. xxvii. 60.)

Christ. That it might appear that I, and not another, arose; and that
by my own power, and not by another's virtue, like him who revived at
the touching of Elisha's bones (2 Kings xiii. 21.)

Soul. Lord, wherefore didst thou raise up thy body again? (Matt.
xxviii. 6.)

Christ. That thou mayst be assured that thy sins are discharged, and
that thou art justified (Rom. iv. 25.)

Soul. Lord, wherefore did so many bodies of thy saints, which slept,
arise at thy resurrection? (Matt. xxvii. 52, 53; Acts xvii. 31.)

virtue of my resurrection, at the last day.
