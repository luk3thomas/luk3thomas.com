# Introduction

> Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.
> [Rom 3:19-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom3)

> The law brings wrath
> [Rom 4:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom4:15)

### An illustration from Pilgrim's Progress

In the book Pilgrim's progress, Faithful recounts his meeting with Adam and the
temptations of original sin. [page 103](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:The_pilgrim%27s_progress_by_John_Bunyan_every_child_can_read_(1909).djvu/103),
[page 104](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:The_pilgrim%27s_progress_by_John_Bunyan_every_child_can_read_(1909).djvu/104)

> I saw there written, "Put off the old man with his deeds."

> I felt him take hold of my flesh, and give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought he had pulled part of me after himself: this made me cry, "O wretched man!"

![adam](/images/adam.jpg)

Afterwards he notices a man in pursuit [page 105](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:The_pilgrim%27s_progress_by_John_Bunyan_every_child_can_read_(1909).djvu/105)

> So I went on my way up the hill. Now, when I had got about half-way up, I
> looked behind me, and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he
> overtook me just about the place where the settle stands.


> So soon as the man overtook me, it was but a word and a blow; for down he
> knocked me, and laid me for dead. But when I was a little come to myself again
> I asked him wherefore he served me so. He said because of my secret inclining
> to Adam the First. And with that he struck me another deadly blow on the
> breast, and beat me down backward; so I lay at his foot as dead as before. So
> when I came to myself again I cried him mercy: but he said, **I know not how to
> show mercy**; and with that he knocked me down again. He had doubtless made an
> end of me, but that one came by and bid him forbear.

### How should the study of the law encourage us?

> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not
> come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
> [Mat 5:17-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matthew5:17-20)

Remember as we move forward in this study that Christ fulfilled **EVERY** duty
required by the law. Even down to the smallest, most minute detail. He never
stumbled. And why did he do this? For the **JOY** set before him. That we may
know God!
