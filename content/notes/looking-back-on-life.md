title: Interview with Bob Jennings before he died
---

I went to a [HeartCry Missionary](http://www.heartcrymissionary.com/)
Conference at Waldo Baptist Church with a group from college in
[2005](http://www.heartcrymissionary.com/resources/sermon-downloads/697-heartcry-conference-2005).
A few days ago I learned that one of the speakers, [Bob
Jennings](http://www.grantedministries.org/categories/By-Featured-Minister/Bob-Jennings/)
died almost a year ago. I started Googling and found an
[interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8UGM3I8WU) with Bob made about a
year before he died. A few of his
[thoughts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8UGM3I8WU&feature=player_detailpage#t=213s)
have stuck with me the past few days. 

> I've been very mindful as a Christian that my life is brief.  You hear older
> Christians say that, you know and preachers tell you that always.  From right
> when I was first converted I was very mindful that my life is brief and that
> we don't have much time and that it is going to go by so quickly.  The
> scripture says it over and over again comparing our life to a sleep,
> comparing our life to runner that passes by, comparing our life to a grass.
> Not rocks, but grass.  Not trees, but grass. And I am very aware of that, but
> now it has happened.
>
> I can remember in my 20s it was like there was something special for each
> year.  I had the thought, I am going to try and remember something about
> every year and for quite a while I could. But then the years ... somehow they
> piled up, they go on and things get blurry it all get muddled together and
> you can't remember something from every year.  The children were young. I can
> hardly believe how quickly the years went by where the children were in the
> house with us. Just all of a sudden the children are grown up and moving out
> and its all over. The chapter is closed. All you can do is make every day
> count for Christ.

At one
[point](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8UGM3I8WU&feature=player_detailpage#t=1482s)
the interviewer asked Bob what he would do if he could live for twelve more
years.

> One thing that I would so like to do is read the Bible more. I mean, just
> conquer the Bible.  And seek to be more useful as a soul winner. I mean there
> is not much of that going on.  There is a lot of evangelism going on, but it
> is such a privilege and a rare thing to be used of God in winning souls.

Towards the end of the interview Bob is
[asked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW8UGM3I8WU&feature=player_detailpage#t=2024s)
how he wants people to remember him in the years to come once he passes away.

> I think every Christian would like to be remembered as a lover of Christ.  I
> mean, 7 or 8 years ago we started this produce farming, and you know, here
> are some pictures of me standing beside a tractor or something like that.
> You do not want to be remembered for that.  That is just nothing.  You want
> to be remembered as a follower of the Lamb.

> Its something isn't it, really that that is all we have.  All we have is the
> Lord.  I mean, we are in a world where sin and death is reigning and it is
> just going to peel and strip away from us our most intimate relationships.
> Our wife, our children everything is going to be stripped.  And that is
> really all we have is Christ.  Collosians 3:11 "Christ is all".  But you want
> to be able to say good bye to your loved ones with everything clean,
> everything clean and no regrets, no bad feelings, no bitterness. That's got
> to be big.
